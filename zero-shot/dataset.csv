"Hi everyone
I have been through the ideas and offer a few (aptly non organised) comments. First Phil is
away and will not be able to comment until later.
First, the project needs more explicit focus. The call will focused on natural variability
. We are offering a detailed analysis of the variability of climate in the Alpine Region
that focuses on CLIVAR timescales - basically very high resolution and not extending much
beyond a few centuries. The project incorporates instrumental , model and palaeodata . The
inter-relationships between these will be studied to gain an understanding of the nature
and mechanisms of the climate variability - but is this enough. I feel it needs to be
linked with a strong element of understanding the range of social/economic impacts of this
variability.
Perhaps looking at aspects such as avalanches, forest damage, floods, tourism etc.? I
merely put this out as a straw man . I feel the EC are putting a lot of emphasis on this
aspect of research and incorporating research and researchers in these or similar areas
will be a big plus.
As for the specific points in the brainstorming document -
The Dendro aspect :
I think it is essential to update the Alpine tree-ring chronologies that are available .
This is because they are a proven asset but many questions regarding tree-productivity (in
relation to observed 20th century climate variability) simply can not be addressed without
doing this. Many were collected over 20 years ago. The additional data would then allow new
processing techniques to be employed and vital questions concerning the changing responses
of tree-growth to explored. The most efficient way to do this is to involve several groups
working in the Alps , (Thank you for sending the Thesis by Giorgio Strumia which is
certainly a very impressive piece of work) I would think Rupert Wimmer's group and the
Birmensdorf group would be ideal (Fritz Schweingruber has retired but Jan Esper has joined
them in his place - I can ask them to be involved but this depends on what the group here
think are the priorities and how much we see as the overall budget and institutional
allocations). I should say here that I think we would require money for a single person who
could , if it is  agreed, work on aspects of tree-ring processing and relationships with
climate in association with the other tree-ring groups, but also work with the climate and
model data , especially with a view to exploring the statistical inter-relationships and
dynamical associations between the different climate data sets. There is also the French
tree-ring group at Marseille? Perhaps though not all need to partners - ALSO I am thinking
of putting together a European Tree-ring project (or suggesting it as part of a large
European integrated proxy study of Holocene variability) so if this happened there could be
a link between it (involving some of the groups mentioned) and this proposal. The Swiss
might be interested to produce selected site tree-ring density/updating which I think would
be very valuable and I will speak to them without commitment as you ask.
As for some of the climate analysis possibilities mentioned, I very much like the ideas of
detailed ,local climate comparisons with the larger CRU (and CRUder!) data. We are very
interested in the association between time dependence in the relationships between
circulation changes and changes in Temp. and Prec. Also changes in the nature of climate
seasonality , and also extreme events (frost frequency , drought, intense rainfall). The
detailed analyses of these characteristics also compliments the interpretational work on
the tree-ring and glacier mass balance (and socio economic foci) data.
As for the glacier work - is not a huge effort already going into this? I think it is
important but does it fit as well ? The work proposed would have to be distinguished from
other ongoing efforts - though I do like the idea of linking the geomorphological evidence
of past glacier change (moraines , pro-glacial sediment data?) with reconstructed glacier
volume changes , where the reconstructions are based on new long instrumental data , and
palaeodata (temp. and precip.) used to drive a model of the glacier volume.  Our German (or
Julie) colleagues can point to such work based on GCM output . My colleague here (Sarah
Raper) has also done this sort of work but using a very simple model to estimate past
Storglaciaren (in Sweden) volume changes  and her results imply that these models must be
forward driven and not based on simple regression analysis using temperature and
precipitation to estimate past mass balance.
The future aspects of the discussion are important - and it is true that the previous EC
call dealt with modelling and scenarios of future changes. Here, I believe the use of
models should be strictly limited to understanding natural /current variability and change.
There is no benefit in going for a 2 year project - I strongly urge 3. I also would find a
meeting difficult. I am away from 17-29 July, and 11-25 August, and in meetings during
7-10th July and 26-31st August.
Phil will be back here next week and will no doubt comment in more detail on the
instrumental analysis aspects then.
Very best wishes to all
Keith

Friends,
As announced last Friday, we want to open a first round of brainstorming about the
contents of our project. We have collected what we have received from You so far and
have it mixed with our own ideas (file Brainstorming-1.doc). It does not have a nice
structure and there are still a number of question marks, as You will see.
Please add things where you think something is missing and please feel free to tell us
which points make no sense, or are too ambitious or simply too much work.
Please consider also the ""how to do it"" (state of the art methods, new approaches to
solve problems, other data than those mentioned, other topics.....).
Please try also to find Your position in the project, tell us what You would prefer to
do....
Please try to consider whether we would have to include other groups in terms of
scientific potential and/or in terms of data (For example: Keith Briffa you mentioned
Fritz Schweingruber as the leading data holder of Alpine tree-ring data. Do you think we
should ask him to join us, or could You use his data also without him being a contractor
of the project? In case You want him in the project could we kindly ask you to contact
him, being much more familiar with him and with the tree-ring topic than we are?)
We would be glad to receive a very short answer from everybody within this week, because
from June 30th to July 15th all the three of us will not be at the institute.
For more detailed considerations and answers You have more time, it would be nice to be
able to study them after our return by mid of July. But please use also the
possibilities to contact  the other groups - the sooner we integrate to a group the
better it is.
Our time-table for the rest of the time until October:
July 16th to August 14th: We are at the institute, hoping to bring the project into a
near to final version what concerns the scientific content
August 15th to August 28th: Ice core conference at Kangerlussuaq (Greenland)
August 29th to September 17th: We are at the institute most of the time. We hope this
will be the time to elaborate the EU-shaped complete version.
September 18th to September 22nd: Big events going on in Vienna which may cut down our
time for the project (150th anniversary of our institute, Climate conference DACH-2001
(in German))
September 24th to October: Time reserved for all the things that could not be done yet
in spite of our time table
Could each of You please inform us about Your time table during summer and autumn?
A question to all of You: How do You think about one 2-days meeting this Summer or in
early September? What place do You prefer? If it is Austria we would have two low cost
possibilities: 1): at our institute  and 2) (more adventurous): At the
Sonnblick-observatory (You do not have to have Alpinistic experience, we have a private
cable car going up)
Some remaining questions:
Should we try a 2-years or a 3-years project?
Can everybody live with roughly 300.000 Euro (This would result into somewhere between
1.5 and two millions, which we heard is a magnitude preferred by the commission). Please
consider not only the sum of money but also how to spend it and how to fill it with a
reasonable equivalent in work amount.
What is your feeling about the ""Climate variability atlas of the Alps""? Is it good to
have one main deliverable like that or should we better produce a number of smaller
things?
One last technical remark:  Please send your comments and mails not only to Vienna, but
also to the other groups (or at least to those You believe would be interested in what
You write). I do not think this would spoil too much our mail boxes and it has the
advantage to include the whole intellectual power of our group into the construction
phase of the proposal.
Looking forward to Your replies, ideas, time tables and anything else
With best regards
Reinhard

"Dear Tom,
Thanks for forwarding the message from John Christy. Excuse me for being
so blunt, but John's message is just a load of utter garbage.
I got a laugh out of John's claim that Santer et al. (2008) was ""poorly
done"". This was kind of ironic coming from a co-author of the Douglass
et al. (2007) paper, which used a fundamentally flawed statistical test
to compare modeled and observed tropospheric temperature trends. To my
knowledge, John has NEVER acknowledged that Douglass et al. used a
flawed statistical test to reach incorrect conclusions - despite
unequivocal evidence from the ""synthetic data"" experiments in Santer et
al. (2008) that the Douglass et al. ""robust consistency"" test was simply
wrong. Unbelievably, Christy continues to assert that the results of
Douglass et al. (2007) ""still stand"". I can only shake my head in
amazement at such intellectual dishonesty. I guess the best form of
defense is a ""robust"" attack.
So how does John support his contention that Santer et al. (2008) was
""poorly done""? He begins by stating that:
""Santer et al. 2008 used ERSST data which I understand has now been
changed in a way that discredits the conclusion there"".
Maybe you or Tom Peterson or Dick Reynolds can enlighten me on this one.
How exactly have NOAA ERSST surface data changed? Recall that Santer et
al. (2008) actually used two different versions of the ERSST data
(version 2 and version 3). We also used HadISST sea-surface temperature
data, and combined SSTs and land 2m temperature data from HadCRUT3v. In
other words, we used four different observational estimates of surface
temperature changes. Our bottom-line conclusion (no significant
discrepancy between modeled and observed lower-tropospheric lapse-rate
trends) was not sensitive to our choice of observed surface temperature
dataset.
John next assets that:
""Haimberger's v1.2-1.4 (of the radiosonde data) are clearly spurious due
to the error in ECMWF as published many places"".
I'll let Leo Haimberger respond to that one. And if v1.2 of Leo's data
is ""clearly spurious"", why did John Christy agree to be a co-author on
the Douglass et al. paper which uses upper-air data from v1.2?
Santer et al. (2008) comprehensively examined structural uncertainties
in the observed upper-air datasets. They looked at two different
satellite and seven different radiosonde-based estimates of tropospheric
temperature change. As in the case of the surface temperature data,
getting the statistical test right was much more important (in terms of
the bottom-line conclusions) than the choice of observational upper-air
dataset.
Christy's next criticism of our IJoC paper is even more absurd. He
states that:
""Santer et al. 2008 asked a very different question...than we did. Our
question was ""Does the IPCC BEST ESTIMATE agree with the Best Data
(including RSS)?"" Answer - No.  Santer et al. asked, ""Does ANY IPCC
model agree with ANY data set?"" ... I think you can see the difference.
Actually, we asked and answered BOTH of these questions. ""Tests with
individual model realizations"" are described in Section 4.1 of Santer et
al. (2008), while Section 4.2 covers ""Tests with multi-model
ensemble-mean trend"". As should be obvious - even to John Christy - we
did NOT just compare observations with results from individual models.
For both types of test (""individual model"" and ""multi-model average""),
we found that, if one applied appropriate statistical tests (which
Douglass et al. failed to do), there was no longer a serious discrepancy
between modeled and observed trends in tropical lapse rates or in
tropical tropospheric temperatures.
Again, I find myself shaking my head in amazement. How can John make
such patently false claims about our paper? The kindest interpretation
is that he is a complete idiot, and has not even bothered to read Santer
et al. (2008) before making erroneous criticisms of it. The less kind
interpretation is that he is deliberately lying.
A good scientist is willing to acknowledge the errors he or she commits
(such as applying an inappropriate statistical test). John Christy is
not a good scientist. I'm not a religious man, but I'm sure willing to
thank some higher authority that Dr. John Christy is not the
""gatekeeper"" of what constitutes sound science.
I hope you don't mind, Tom, but I'm copying this email to some of the
other co-authors of the Santer et al. (2008) IJoC paper. They deserve to
know about the kind of disinformation Christy is spreading.
With best regards,
Ben

in response to Nadia's message and our talk - consider the following as regards title and
objectives
Title
The precedence of Ecological  Responses to 20th Century Climate changes in Arctic Lakes and
Trees
Suggested Objectives
We will quantify how the changes in 20th century Arctic climate (including mean and
variability) are reflected in recent and past lake sediment records. We will determine the
response of lake ecosystem  parameters and the relationships with specific climatic
controls.
We will define the character of variability in different natural archives contained in
dated sediments reaching back over 2000 years. We will generate well-calibrated ,
high-resolution (decadal to centennial time scales) estimates of past summer climate
variability over this time in western Arctic Siberia.
We will compare the lake sediment data with evidence of tree-growth and associated summer
climate changes , based on selected updating of an extensive, existing network of
chronologies, including long sub-fossil series extending back more than 4000 years in Yamal
and Taimyr. These  data (with perfect inter-annual dating accuracy) will be reprocessed to
provide summer temperatures specifically representative of annual, decadal and centennial
timescales.
We will determine (for the first time) the extent to which the independent proxy-based
summer climate  histories concur or disagree and explore the extent to which they
demonstrate the precedence of  recent (20th century ) climate trends  in a multi-millennial
context. By comparing this evidence with the output of state-of-the-art GCM experiments ,
simulating climate changes in the Arctic over the last 500 to 1000 years, we will explore
the degree to which recent changes in Arctic lakes (and tree-growth rates) are attributable
to anthropogenic as opposed to natural climate changes.

Dear readers,
If the majority of your photos are posed snapshots and
landscapes, a fast camera may not matter. But if you've ever
missed a shot because your camera was busy processing the
previous photo, the Leica Digilux 1 will appeal to you. We liked
it too, and we gave it an Editors' Choice award.
Leica Digilux 1: Legendary charm
The legendary German lens maker takes aim at digital-era
street photographers with the Digilux 1. A combination of
speed, manual control, and advanced features helps this

"Pennsylvania voters overwhelmingly oppose Sen. Pat Toomey's obstruction of Chief Judge Merrick Garland's Supreme Court nomination.
Today, the Constitutional Responsibility Project released its first television ad. The 30-second spot
showcases Sen. Toomey's (R-PA) unprecedented refusal to consider any Supreme Court nominee and calls on Sen. Toomey to put the Constitution before his politics. The ad will air in the Philadelphia media market over the Senate recess.
Additionally, the Constitutional Responsibility Project, in conjunction with the League of Conservation Voters, released a new survey of Pennsylvania voters conducted by Hart Research. The survey found that Pennsylvania voters support giving Judge Garland a hearing and an up-or-down vote and strongly disapprove of the positon Senate Republican leadership has taken on this matter.
""This poll shows that Pennsylvanians strongly believe that Senator Toomey and others must give the president's nominee both a fair hearing and a timely vote, and LCV members couldn't agree more.  Nearly 150,000 of them have signed a petition calling on the Senate to do its job, including nearly 5,000 in Pennsylvania alone,"" said Tiernan Sittenfeld, Senior Vice President of Government Affairs, League of Conservation Voters.
A full memo from Hart Research Associates outlining the survey's findings and polling method can be found HERE
.
Key findings from the Constitutional Responsibility Project and the League of Conservation Voters survey include:
*   By a margin of 56 percent to 37 percent, Pennsylvania voters say the Senate should hold hearings and give Chief Judge Garland an up-or-down-vote.
*   Independent voters agree with this position by an event larger margin - 60 percent to 36 percent.
*   After voters hear the pros and cons on Senator Toomey's positon on the Supreme Court vacancy, feelings toward him become notably less favorable.
*   Independents move from a small net positive view of Toomey (24 percent positive, 18 percent negative) to a large net negative opinion of him (24 percent positive, 50 percent negative).
*   At the start of the survey, 43 percent of voters said they were inclined to vote for Senator Toomey over his Democratic challenger. After being told about his stance on Judge Garland's nomination, 46 percent of voters said they are less likely to support Senator Toomey.
*   16 percent of voters said they would be more open to voting for the Democratic challenger as a result of Senator Toomey's opposition to hearings and a vote for Judge Garland.
Wisconsin voters do not approve of Sen. Johnson's Supreme Court obstruction.
Roll Call
reports on a new poll finding that Sen. Ron Johnson's (R-WI) continued refusal to consider Chief Judge Garland's nomination runs counter to the values of Wisconsin voters.
""60 percent of likely Wisconsin voters want to see the president and Senate take action to fill the vacancy now... Roughly half of voters felt that by blocking Obama's nominee, senators were ""trying to advance their party's agenda rather than doing what is right for the country.""
After meeting with Chief Merrick Garland yesterday, Sen. Gary Peters lauds his ""impeccable legal credentials.
The Detroit News
reports:
Sen. Peters (D-MI): ""He comes to this nomination with ... impeccable legal credentials. On top of that, he has the benefit of already being confirmed for his current position with broad bipartisan support. So this is the type of candidate that certainly deserves to have a hearing.""""
Chief Judge Garland is exactly the type of jurist we want on the Court.
Former U.S. solicitor general Ted Olson writes in the Wall Street Journal
:
Ted Olson, former U.S. solicitor general: ""Mr. Garland is extraordinarily well qualified...Throughout his career, he has impressed his colleagues and his legal adversaries with his leadership, sense of fairness, and respect for the law. He has been a judge for 19 years and is now chief judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, considered by many to be the second-most-important court in the country. Scalia and three current justices also served on the D.C. circuit. By temperament, character and qualifications, Judge Garland is precisely the kind of jurist we want on the Supreme Court.  For Republicans, there is much to recommend giving Mr. Garland a good look, a respectful hearing and a vote on the merits.""
Chief Judge Garland will approach the legal issues that face the disability community with thought and care.
Michael Waterston, an expert in disability and civil rights law, reviewed Chief Judge Garland's record and found him to be a thoughtful and fair jurist.
Michael Waterstone, disability and civil rights law expert: ""How will Justice Garland rule on the important issues facing the disability community - things like whether websites need to be accessible to individuals who are blind, or how far employers need to go in providing accommodations to workers with disabilities, or whether voters with disabilities are entitled to secret and independent ballots, like everyone else? I don't know...But I do feel confident that Justice Garland would approach the questions carefully and thoughtfully, and without a predefined agenda against the rights of people with disabilities.""[Loyola Law School, 4/28/16

"Dear friends of the Imprint - SSC,
After seeing the evaluation summary of our
proposal, and not least the same for Millennium,
it is clear to me that we have been very badly
treated, first by the public advice from the
Commission in Utrecht who advised the community
to create a proposal which we did, but which is
orthogonal to what they now have decided to
negotiate, later by the random way we were
reviewed and the many inconsistencies in the
evaluation. Compared to this the Millennium
review was full of subjective phrases and a
number of negative aspects were glossed over.
The review is an insult, and it appears likely
that elements in the panel bear some grudges
against our community. In order to get the 0.5
point difference between Imprint and Millennium
they had to give a number of very imbalanced
statements. They also had to raise the management
score of Millennium to 4 by the xtended panel
despite critisisms by the reviewers  that the
management was not well laid out.
I feel that the review was very biased and the
result is that they will probably fund a project
with only limited relevance to the call, and miss
a major opportunity of integrating European
paleoclimate research and climate modelling and
create a new major step forward.
We have been advised to send a formal letter of
complaint to the Commission, asking for a renewed
evaluation, not because we think there is a good
chance that it will lead to much, but we think it
is important that they know that they have upset
a community consisting of top level European
scientists, This may help us in the longer term.
The advice I have got is to send this to Pierre
Valette, co-signed by the key partners, both
their PIs and head of administration, with copies
to our individual national members of the Global
Change Panel of the EU.
So far there is no formal decision on which
proposal to fund, this may happen in September
after negotiations with the selected proposals.
There is a seldom precedence in Europe that such
an intervention has been successful, but very
rarely.
In phrasing such a letter we have to be very
careful and make sure our message is clear and
fair, but I think it needs to be done.
I would therefore ask you to respond immediately
to this mail as to whether you think we should go
this route or not. We will then in a few days
send out a draft for comments, if you agree that
we shall send in a complaint. We have to move
fast here, so I hope you will be quick.
Concerning the other proposals on what to do,
there are many good ideas, and I think we should
have a meeting in the autumn to discuss the
strategy of securing paleo in the 7th Framwork
program. The text is out for review now, and we
all need to suggest changes through our national
representatives. I will distribute a list of who
this is for the various countries over the
week-end.
I am also working on formulating  text to help
launch our ideas in teh European Parliament via
Atte´s wife.

XXVI General Assembly, Spring EGS Meeting
Comparison of Large-Scale Proxy-Based Temperature Reconstructions Over the
Past Few Centuries
MANN, M.E.; RUTHERFORD, S; OSBORN, T.J.
OA28.0  Study of past climates: Climate of the past millennium
JOUZEL, J.; (co-conveners: JONES, P.D.; MANN, M.E.)
Comparison of Large-Scale Proxy-Based Temperature Reconstructions Over the
Past Few Centuries
M.E. Mann(1), S. Rutherford(1), and T.J. Osborn(2)
(1) Univ. of Virginia, USA, (2) Climate Research Unit, Univ. East Anglia, UK
A  promising approach to the problem of reconstructing patterns of past
climate variability
involves the application of spatial climate field reconstruction (CFR)
techniques to networks of proxy
climate indicators (e.g., Mann et al 1998;2000--see

This approach seeks to exploit the complimentary information in a diverse
network of proxy indicators by determining the most consistent
relationships between these
networks of data and  the leading spatial patterns of climate variability
during a recent ""calibration"" period of overlap with the modern
instrumental record.
The calibrated relationship is then used to estimate large-scale patterns
of climate variability
in the past from the proxy data. This method makes no  assumptions regarding
the relationship between a given proxy indicator and specific local
annual/seasonal climate variable, but
does assume that the proxy indicator is tied to some combination of
large-scale patterns of climate variability.
Alternatively,  it is possible to  estimate large-scale temperature
patterns from a relatively homogenous network
of proxy climate indicators (e.g., tree-ring density data--see Briffa et
al, 1998) by invoking
a local calibration between each climate indicator and the climate variable
(e.g., summer temperature)
of interest. This approach is more conservative in the amount of
information it seeks to
extract from the proxy data network, but it is free from assumptions
regarding the large-scale
patterns of past climate variability. Recent reconstructions of Northern
Hemisphere annual-mean and
warm-season temperature patterns using these respective approaches and data
show some similarities,
but also some important differences. Here we investigate these differences
more closely, examining
the sensitivity of Northern Hemisphere temperature pattern reconstructions
to (a) the underlying
proxy data used, (b) the particular method used to estimate large-scale
patterns from these data,
and (c) the target  seasonality of the reconstruction. By controlling
independently for each of these
three factors, we gain insight into the reasons for differences between
various proxy-based estimates
of past large-scale temperature variability.

"NSM News Release:
German Government Hate's Free Speech, persecutes White Musicians & Activists:
I was just informed that one of the new German bands on the NSM Record Label had 4 of their recorded songs for their upcoming cd release on NSM Records, and their instruments seized by the German Government. The name of the band is Gojm, or Goyim in English (Goyim is a jewish word for Gentiles meaning Human Cattle).
What the German Zog does not know is that the 4 tracks they seized were the bonus tracks for the album, the other 8 songs, 39 minutes of music was already recorded and has already left Germany to be released here by NSM Records in the United States. The band has not been arrested, but as they put it, their songs and instruments were arrested.
We will release the forbidden/verboten cd with the 8 tracks that made it out of Germany, and if the other tracks are ever returned we may make them available on-line as free mp3's, or use them on a future release.
Here in the U.S. we still have the right to Freedom of speech, and musical freedom to play whatever kind of music we want. In Nations like Germany, a cd, questioning the Holohoax, a song, a Politically incorrect newspaper, or even a Salute can get you thrown in jail.
The German Government crackdown on musicians/bands such as musical greats like Landser, and countless other National Socialists activists, including the thousands of Political Prisoners in German jails rotting away for speaking words of truth and Patriotism, should light a fire under all of us to do even more in the Worldwide struggle for National Socialism.
I will end this NSM News Release with a message to the German Government: Your Tyranny against your own Citizens has not gone unnoticed by the International Community, nor the thousands of our Comrades you jail for thought and speech crimes. You are breeding a Revolution, a Revolution that is just about ready to snap and breakout into your streets, especially in the East. We National Socialists here in the U.S., and our International Allies will continue to do our part to support those you persecute.

I'll forward it on to Gil Compo and others linked to ACRE and
the AOPC WGs.  I think that Roger Stone from Queensland knows some of
your people, so there should be some good links all round.
I've also gone back to Howard Diamond, the US GCOS Rep, from
whom I'm hoping to get some financial support for such a meeting to
gauge his reaction to holding it in Europe.
Cheers,  Rob.

Former critic plans 'Lobbyists for Trump' fundraiser
Washington Examiner - Gabby Morrongiello
A top Washington lobbyist who previously called Donald Trump ""a joke,"" now plans to host a fundraiser for the Republican presidential front-runner in early June.
Jack Burkman of J.M. Burkman and Associates will host government relations professionals and other lobbyists in the D.C. suburb of Arlington, Va. on June 10 as part of his ""Lobbyists for Trump"" effort.
According to an advisory released Monday, Burkman intends to raise $200 million over the next six months for the leading GOP candidate to use should he make it to the general election.
Burkman's effort to fundraise for the New York billionaire comes seven months after the D.C. lobbyist took out a full-page ad in the Los Angeles Daily News criticizing Trump and the other Republican presidential hopefuls at the time for not taking a firm stance against same-sex marriage.
""Donald Trump: You have no moral compass. You've been pro-choice, pro-life, pro-choice and now pro-life again,"" Burkman wrote in the ad.
He added, ""You'd believe anything that would get you elected. You're a joke.""
Burkman did not return the Washington Examiner's request for comment.",Placeholder,Placeholder explanation

Cambodia temple ruins yield treasure
Workers clearing dense jungle near the ruins of an ancient pagoda in
northern Cambodia have unearthed 31 Buddha statues - 27 of them solid gold.
The statues - which are 10 centimetres (4 inches) tall - are in good
condition and believed to be hundreds of years old.
They were found on Saturday as workers were rebuilding the Po Pich temple
about 100 km (65miles) north of the capital, Phnom Penh.
The pagoda, in the Batay district of Kampong Thom province, was torn down
during the reign of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s and the area became
overgrown.
Community care
Deputy police chief of Kampong Thom province, Hang Sithim, said the statues
- three of which were silver and one bronze - were buried in about one metre
(3.4ft) of earth and each weigh around 500 grams (1lb).
''I think that these Buddha statues had been buried hundreds of years ago,
when the last temple was fully operating,"" Mr Hang Sithim said.
Provincial authorities initially planned to take the statues to a nearby
town for safekeeping, but opted to allow the Buddhist community at the
temple to take care of them.
''We believe they are safe there,'' said Som Somphat, deputy governor of
Kampong Thom province.
''The people of Po Pich pledged to treat them with respect and honour.''
Reign of terror
A police guard has been placed around the site to protect it from looters.
The Khmer Rouge waged civil war in Cambodia between 1970 and 1998 and
controlled the country between 1975 and 1979.
The regime outlawed religion and destroyed many objects regarded as decadent
or culturally impure.
About two million people died in the Khmer Rouge's drive to turn Cambodia
into a farmers' utopia.

"Trump aides huddle with RNC to plot big-money strategy
The presumptive nominee seeks to exert control over the Republican Party.
By KENNETH P. VOGEL, ELI STOKOLS and ALEX ISENSTADT
05/09/16 05:26 PM EDT
Updated 05/09/16 06:17 PM EDT
Donald Trump's campaign is hashing out the details of an agreement with Republican Party leaders that could allow the presumptive GOP presidential nominee to raise six-figure checks for his presidential campaign, multiple sources with direct knowledge of the negotiations tell POLITICO.
The fundraising agreement was among the subjects discussed at a Monday meeting at the Republican National Committee's Washington offices between top RNC officials, including chairman Reince Priebus, and senior Trump aides, including campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, senior adviser Paul Manafort and political director Rick Wiley, according to the sources.
The talks represent the first formal steps towards a merger between the official apparatus of the Republican Party and a candidate who many party leaders scorned until recently, and about whom there remains deep leeriness in some Republican quarters.
Since Trump essentially clinched the GOP nomination with a win in last week's Indiana primary, his staff have moved quickly to put their stamp on the party's general election planning process. Wiley has paid several visits to the party's headquarters on Capitol Hill to assess its efforts, according to the sources. The campaign also has been discussing convention-related issues with the RNC, including credentials and rules, the sources said, adding that the campaign is expected in the coming days to formally deputize a staffer as a liaison to the national party committee.
And deputy campaign manager Michael Glassner this week is set to lead a delegation to the convention site, Cleveland's Quicken Loans Arena, to receive a briefing from RNC officials involved in planning for the July event, as POLITICO first reported
last week.
Fundraising was not a major focus of Monday's meetings, according to RNC senior strategist Sean Spicer. ""It was 3 ½ hours on briefings from all the RNC divisions regarding the capabilities and resources that we have been compiling to win in November,"" said Spicer, who attended the meeting, and said it included presentations on the party's ground game, and its data, communications and research efforts.
The conversations are also partly an effort to lay the groundwork for a Thursday meeting in Washington between Trump, Priebus and House Speaker Paul Ryan, who announced last Thursday that he is withholding his endorsement until Trump outlines a stronger commitment to conservative principles.
The perception among Trump's inner circle is that Ryan is attempting to leverage his position as chairman of the Cleveland convention into securing a deal that protects the party's control over vendor contracts and how the money raised jointly by the party and Trump's campaign is spent.
""Trump is a tough negotiator, understands the history of what he's entitled to here,"" another Trump confidant said. ""They want the RNC to be autonomous but they'll work with the Trump campaign. They need Trump to help raise the money but they want their vendors to be the ones to spend the money.""
But Trump may be more reliant on the national party than past presidential nominees, since his campaign has invested relatively little in field staff, voter data or a fundraising operation.
Some of Trump's infrastructure deficiencies can be traced to his unwillingness to dig deep into his own fortune to finance his campaign, which he has pledged from the beginning to self-finance.
Entering into a joint fundraising agreement and leaning on the party for cash and staff would help fill that void in an election expected to cost each side more than $1 billion. But it also could undermine his rhetoric about being independent from the party's donor class.
Trump has already agreed to appear next week at a $25,000 per-plate fundraiser to benefit the New Jersey Republican Party, just days after the New York billionaire tapped Gov. Chris Christie to run his presidential transition.
The May 19 event is being billed as a ""roundtable"" with Christie and Trump, and will be held at the Lawrenceville National Guard Armory, according to an invitation obtained by POLITICO. Just 12 people will be permitted to attend the roundtable, according to a note sent with the invitation.
The RNC has been taking the lead in reaching out to state parties to put together the joint fundraising arrangement with Trump's campaign, and its plans are actually further along than they were at this point four years ago, said one source familiar with the negotiations.
""I know (the Trump campaign staff) have been impressed with what the RNC already has on the ground,"" said the source. ""Four years ago, when Romney walked into the building, the RNC didn't have anywhere close to the field staff that it has now. ... There is a big difference.""
Yet efforts to finalize the agreement also could test the willingness of state GOP officials to get behind a presumptive nominee who some official openly opposed during the contentious primary.
Colorado's state party appeared to gloat last month after Trump's vanquished rival Ted Cruz swept all 34 delegate slots at the state's caucus. ""We did it. #NeverTrump,"" the state party tweeted, only to delete and disavow
the post minutes later.
Party spokesman Kyle Kohli on Monday said the Colorado GOP hasn't had any talks with Trump or the RNC about a joint fundraising agreement.
The South Carolina Republican Party is open to participating but hasn't engaged in any talks yet, said the chairman, Matt Moore.
The more state parties that participate, the more money a Trump joint fundraising committee can accept, thanks in part to a 2014 Supreme Court case called McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission
. It struck down aggregate limits on total giving to federal campaigns, allowing maximum donations to as many different committees as a donor wanted.
Trump's likely general election opponent, Hillary Clinton, created an unprecedented joint fundraising committee
with the Democratic National Committee and 32 state party committees that can accept checks as large as $356,100 this year.
Early in the election cycle, the talk among GOP state party officials was of a joint fundraising committee that could include all 50 states and six territories, allowing maximum donations of about $1 million per person, according to one state party chairman. But those talks quieted as Trump's surprising rise threw the GOP primary into chaos, said the chairman.
Sources with knowledge of the RNC's current plans said its joint fundraising arrangement would include between four and 12 state committees, which could allow the committee to accept checks ranging from $78,800 and $158,000.
The joint committee could help Trump's campaign as well as the RNC, which has struggled to keep its finances intact. The committee ended March with just $16 million on hand and nearly $2 million in outstanding debt. Taken together, the bank account is a fraction of where the committee had been at similar points in 2008 and 2012.
Many Republican state party chairs, who depend on the RNC to fund a get-out-the-vote program, are anxious to see Trump and the committee form an agreement.
""We are a battleground state and we can expect a lot of money to support our push,"" said Rob Gleason, the Pennsylvania GOP chair. ""We already were getting a lot of money from the RNC, but we need a lot more.""
""Trump should be able to get us up to speed,"" he added.",Placeholder,Placeholder explanation

Mike, Ray, Caspar,
A couple of things - don't pass on either.
1. Have seen you're RC bet. Not entirely sure this is the right way to go,
but it will drum up some discussion.
Anyway Mike and Caspar have seen me present possible problems with the
SST data (in the 1940s/50s and since about 2000). The first of these will appear
in Nature on May 29. There should be a News and Views item with this article
by Dick Reynolds. The paper concludes by pointing out that SSTs now (or since
about 2000, when the effect gets larger) are likely too low. This likely won't
get corrected quickly as it really needs more overlap to increase confidence.
Bottom line for me is that it appears SSTs now are about 0.1 deg C too cool
globally. Issue is that the preponderance of drifters now (which measure SST
better but between 0.1 and 0.2 lower than ships) mean anomalies are low
relative to the ship-based 1961-90 base.
This also means that the SST base the German modellers used in their runs
was likely too warm by a similar amount. This applies to all modellers, reanalyses etc.
There will be a lot of discussion of the global T series with people saying we can't
even measure it properly now.
The 1940s/50s problem with SSTs (the May 29 paper) also means there will be
warmer SSTs for about 10 years. This will move the post-40s cooling to a little
later - more in line with higher sulphate aerosol loading in the late 50s and 1960s70s.
The paper doesn't provide a correction. This will come, but will include the addition
of loads more British SSTs for WW2, which may very slightly cool the WW2 years.
More British SST data have also been digitized for the late 1940s. Budget
constraints mean that only about half the RN log books have been digitized. Emphasis
has been given to the South Atlantic and Indian Ocean log books.
As an aside, it is unfortunate that there are few in the Pacific. They have digitized
all the logbooks of the ships journeys from the Indian Ocean south of Australia and NZ
to Seattle for refits. Nice bit of history here - it turns out that most of the ships
are
US ones the UK got under the Churchill/Roosevelt deal in early 1940. All the RN bases
in South Africa, India and Australia didn't have parts for these ships for a few years.
So the German group would be stupid to take your bet.  There is a likely
ongoing negative volcanic event in the offing!
2. You can delete this attachment if you want. Keep this quiet also, but
this is the person who is putting in FOI requests for all emails Keith and Tim
have written and received re Ch 6 of AR4. We think we've found a way
around this.
I can't wait for the Wengen review to come out with the Appendix showing what
that 1990 IPCC Figure was really based on.
The Garnaut review appears to be an Australian version of the Stern Report.
This message will self destruct in 10 seconds!

Subject: ICYMI: Donald Trump and the Art of the Tax Loophole
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Donald Trump and the Art of the Tax Loophole
The New York Times
By Steven Rattner
May 13, 2016

​-​
stops/donald-trump-and-the-art-of-the-tax-loophole.html
TYPE “Trump system rigged” into the Google search bar and you’ll get more than 500,000 hits. I didn’t inspect all of them but the first 50 were variants of Donald Trump complaining that the Republican primary process was tilted against him.
That’s beyond ironic. Mr. Trump and his family have been the beneficiaries of a great rigged system: the tax code, which bestows huge advantages on the real estate business. Throughout his career, Mr. Trump has not only grabbed for every loophole and legal lever he could find, he’s boasted about it.
“I’ve taken advantage of the laws of this country, like other people,” Mr. Trump has said.
The Republican front-runner has been dodging releasing his returns on the specious grounds that he was being audited. On Tuesday, he told The Associated Press that he wouldn’t release them before the election — period. On Wednesday, he denied saying this, reversed course and said,“Hopefully before the election I’ll release.”
“There’s nothing to learn from them,” he said in the Associated Press interview.
I’ll bet there’s plenty to learn. More likely, Mr. Trump doesn’t want us to know how small his tax hit is, something that he bragged about earlier in the campaign, before realizing that it could come back to bite him.
“I fight like hell to pay as little as possible,” Mr. Trump said last August.
Real estate guys can take advantage of the best loopholes left in the tax code, thanks in part to some aggressive nudging of lawmakers. For starters, real estate investors can take deductions for the ostensible depreciation of the value of their buildings, even though the point of owning buildings is that they generally appreciate.
For another, they often borrow against those properties, and because they hold these investments in partnerships or limited liability companies, the interest payments are tax-deductible.
“If you get close to paying taxes, you just buy another building,” a real estate friend told me.
If Mr. Trump were to sell a property, the profits would be taxed as capital gains at far lower rates (23.8 percent) than those imposed on ordinary income (39.6 percent). But real estate owners often don’t even pay capital gains taxes. They can take advantage of a provision known as Section 1031 to swap a piece of real estate that they are ready to part with for one that they would like to add to their portfolio — all tax free. There is no limit on how many swaps they can make, deferring capital gains taxes indefinitely.
Section 1031 is among the real estate operators’ favorite provisions — and it’s a break not readily available to other kinds of investors. No wonder that attempts to rein in or eliminate Section 1031, including a recent one by the Obama administration, have been met with fierce resistance from the industry.
The tax benefits don’t stop, even at death. If an investor dies holding appreciated properties, the heirs get a step up in basis, which means that they can sell the real estate and pay no taxes on the gain in value.
Mr. Trump’s quest for loopholes ranges far. In 2005, he got a $39.1 million tax deduction for donating a conservation easement on a New Jersey golf course, meaning that any further development on the property is restricted. On top of that, he installed goats on two of his New Jersey golf courses as part of a plan to get them designated as agricultural properties, thereby vastly lowering his property taxes.
Meanwhile, according to Mr. Trump’s campaign, from 2010 to 2014, he “donated” more than $102 million to charity — without giving away even $1 of his own money. More conservation easements constituted the biggest source of deductions, but the “gifts” included items like free rounds of golf for charity events. Many of these “charitable contributions,” of course, gave rise to more tax deductions.
Taxes are far from the only way that Mr. Trump has gamed the system. He’s added materially to his net worth by pushing the edges of the bankruptcy laws.
By arguing that his name had huge commercial value, for example, he managed to retain more ownership in his Atlantic City hotel and casino projects than is customary in an insolvency, thereby minimizing his losses while his creditors lost billions.
Finally, by his own admission, Mr. Trump has used our broken campaign finance system to achieve private gain by giving generously to politicians of both parties (including to Hillary Clinton) in order to gain influence. Since 1989, he has donated more than $1.5 million to political causes, 62 percent of it going to Republicans, according to PolitiFact.
“When they call, I give,” Mr. Trump said in the first Republican debate. “And you know what? When I need something from them, two years later, three years later, I call them. They are there for me.”
Among the ways that politicians have been there for him and his brethren has been developing a tax system in which real estate moguls pay little or no taxes. “The Declaration of Independence tells us that all men are created equal, but the government definitely favors real estate investors!” wrote one such investor, David Lindahl. Where did this appear? “Trump University Commercial Real Estate Investing 101.”

"Talking about Ted Cruz, and about how to make GOP convention more exciting
Please Save from yesterday: 
Donald Trump called on Ted Cruz on Monday to quit the presidential race and go back to the U.S. Senate if Tuesday's Indiana primary ends with the billlionaire beating the senator.
'Yes, he should. He should leave the race if I win,' Trump told DailyMail.com in a wide-ranging interview at an Indianapolis hotel during his last day of campaigning in the Hoosier State.
'Now, let's see what happens. Indiana's a great state and I have the support of Bobby Knight and so many other people. We'll have to see what happens, but yes, I think he should get out of the race,' Trump said.
The Republican front-runner also said Cruz's 'tough temperament' might make him unsuitable for a spot on his short-list of potential Supreme Court nominees – a consolation prize he could offer the Texas as a party-unifying gesture.
Instead, Trump insisted Ted prepare to pack his bags – and doubled down on his demand later during a lunchtime stop at Shapiro's Delicatessen a few blocks from Lucas Oil Stadium.
Asked during an impromptu press gaggle whether an Indiana defeat should spell the end of a Cruz candidacy, he told reporters: 'I think it should.'
A Cruz spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Monday morning's interview touched on Trump's foreign policy goals, his attitude toward the media, his criticism of past Republican National Conventions, and whether a President Trump would deliver a comedy routine at the White House Correspondents Association's annual gala.
Indiana's 57 delegates to the Republican National Convention, should Trump claim them in Tuesday's winner-take-all primary election, would put the businessman within striking distance of the magic number – 1,237 – that he needs in order to become the party's White House nominee.
Cruz has insisted that he will stay in the contest all the way to the July convention in Cleveland, Ohio.
he launched an ad Monday in Indiana in which he tries to turn Trump's nickname for him – 'Lyin' Ted' – back on the real estate tycoon.
The ad, titled 'Lying,' features an announcer claiming that 'Donald Trump is lying about Ted Cruz' with respect to the senator's positions on trade, illegal immigration and work visas.
'Trump also had a one-million-dollar judgment against him for hiring illegals,' the ad claims.
'What a phony.'
But Indianans seem to be siding with Trump, giving him a 15-point edge in an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released yesterday.
Trump lashed out at Cruz Monday morning, telling DailyMail.com that he disagrees with the Texan's characterization of him earlier in the day as a hateful bully and his base as 'bitter, angry, petty, bigoted people.'
'That is not America. I reject that vision of America,' Cruz told reporters in Indiana after a campaign stop.
'They're not angry,' Trump said of his loyal following. 'They're very disappointed in politicians like him that get a lot of money from special interest groups, and they protect their special interest groups very much to the detriment of the country.'
Trump has faced calls for specifics about how he will 'unify' the Republican Party if he performs well enough in the remaining ten primary elections to claim the GOP's nomination outright.
But the billionaire said he isn't ready to put Cruz on the Supreme Court as a consolation prize – because his 'temperament' might not be suited to the job.
Cruz, once the solicitor general for the Lone Star State, argued nine cases before America's highest court, winning five of them.
'I don't know. I'd have to think about it. That's a big decision,' he told DailyMail.com, saying that he's aware of Cruz's record as a constitutional lawyer.
'But there's a whole question of uniting, and there's a whole question as to temperament. And I'd have to think about it.'
Trump raised Cruz's 'temperament' four separate times while explaining why putting the lawmaker on his Supreme Court short-list wasn't an easy call.
He has said in the past that in order to quell conservatives' concerns about how he would approach Supreme Court appointments, he would release a list of names during the campaign and pledge to to only choose nominees from it.
'He's got a tough temperament for what we're talking about,' Trump said of Cruz. 'You have to be a very, very smart, rational person in my opinion, to be a justice of any kind at a high level or low.'
'You need a proper temperament. And that would be a question that I would have.'
At Shapiro's, Trump projected confidence as the lunch crowd milled around him and asked for autographs and selfies. He signed one man's $50 bill before dining at a table that included campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and nonfiction author Ed Klein.
Asked whether the general election season begins for him on Wednesday, he said: 'Yes, I mean it's sort of already started.'
Citing a new national poll, he added: 'Rasmussen just came out and I'm three points up on Hillary ... and I haven't even started yet.'",Placeholder,Placeholder explanation

"I need everyone to send on this time!
TeenScreen is really on the run. If we get our message
to enough people right now, we'll win this game.
TeenScreen will completely disappear and the youth of
America can grow up safely without TeenScreen's
intervention and drugs.
In the last week, there was an article on raising
money for suicide programs in the Vallejo (California)
Times-Herald. Then on Friday they published a letter
to the editor from TeenScreen's director, full of
lies, and with the total intention to gain support for
their suppressive cause.
We need to overwhelm this paper with true data.
Do you know why TeenScreen has been able to get so
far? Because there is a vacuum of information on
suicide. If TeenScreen is the only one popping up and
saying 'here's a solution', they'll win.
The assignment:
1. Read Leslie MacGuire's letter at this link or the
text at the bottom of this message:

2. Rip her to shreds.
Write a letter to the editor and send it to
opinion@timesheraldonline.com
You can write what you want but I have a suggestion.
-If your last name begins with A-C, L-M, or S-Z, I
want you to state that you are writing in response to
MacGuire's letter. You can say almost anything and you
don't have to be nice. I suggest that you point out
that her letter is just advertising, not public
opinion, that suicide screening has never been shown
to reduce suicide, that TeenScreen just leads to more
drugging with drugs known to cause suicide, and that
the use of TeenScreen takes money and effort away from
programs that actually are proven to work! - like
volunteer suicide hotlines, improving education, drug
abuse prevention programs, religious programs. Hell,
you can throw in ""Set a Good Example"" contest and ""The
Way to Happiness"" if you feel like. It will make them
look it up.
-If your last name begins with the other letters, I
suggest that you ignore Leslie and write a letter to
the editor in response to the original article. I
can't deliver you a copy of that article because it's
fee-based. I'm sure it says something about raising
money to prevent suicide and that's all you really
need to know. Your letter mention things like the fact
that mental health screening is bad and just leads to
more psych drug use, that our leaders should find the
true and workable solutions and not just accept any
program that is offered. Also you could bring out the
fact that
suicide is VERY rare, not an epidemic, that there are
other more serious problems like illiteracy and drug
abuse.
3. And report compliance by email.
Thank you!
Doyle
______________________________
LETTER TEXT:
A critical issue
Thank you for your article regarding the recent walk
to raise money for suicide prevention programs
(""Shining a light in the darkness of suicide,"" May
22). Coverage on this important topic helps to shed
light on the critical issue of suicide, a very real
and prevalent problem that is too often overlooked.
In California, suicide is the third leading cause of
death for 15- to
19-year-olds. Studies by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) show that 17 percent of
American high school students think seriously about
suicide and 9 percent have made a suicide attempt.
Research tells us that 90 percent of youth who die by
suicide suffer from a diagnosable and treatable mental
illness at the time of their death, but the vast
majority of these teens are not known to their
parents, teachers or other adults as suffering from a
mental disorder.
In response to this public health crisis, Columbia
University has spent more than a decade developing,
implementing, and evaluating its TeenScreen Program.
TeenScreen is a voluntary mental health screening
program that provides communities throughout the
nation with free tools and training to identify youth
who are at risk for suicide and those suffering from
unidentified mental illness. Screening is always
voluntary and no child is screened without a parent's
permission.
Mental illness and suicide are public health issues
which should be public concerns. I applaud your
community for taking interest in this critical issue,
and strongly encourage parents, health professionals,
educators and others in your community to prioritize
early intervention and prevention initiatives
including mental health screening to help prevent
unnecessary suffering and the tragedy of suicide.
Leslie McGuire, Director, Columbia University

"Dear folks,
You may be interesting in this snippet of information about
Pat Michaels. Perhaps the University of Wisconsin ought to
open up a public comment period to decide whether Pat Michaels,
PhD needs re-assessing?
Michaels' PhD was, I believe, supervised by Reid Bryson. It dealt
with statistical (regression-based) modeling of crop-climate
relationships. In his thesis, Michaels claims that his statistical
model showed that weather/climate  variations could explain 95%
of the inter-annual variability in crop yields. Had this been
correct, it would have been a remarkable results. Certainly, it
was at odds with all previous studies of crop-climate relationships,
which generally showed that weather/climate could only explain about
50% of inter-annual yield variability.
How did result come about? The answer is simple. In Michaels'
regressions he included a trend term. This was at the time a common
way to account for the effects of changing technology on yield. It
turns out that the trend term accounts for 90% of the variability,
so that, in Michaels' regressions, weather/climate explains just 5
of the remaining 10%. In other words, Michaels' claim that
weather/climate explains 95% of the variability is completely
bogus.
Apparently, none of Michaels' thesis examiners noticed this. We
are left with wondering whether this was deliberate misrepresentation
by Michaels, or whether it was simply ignorance.
As an historical note, I discovered this many years ago when working
with Dick Warrick and Tu Qipu on crop-climate modeling. We used a
spatial regression method, which we developed for the wheat belt of
southwestern Western Australia. We carried out similar analyses for
winter wheat in the USA, but never published the results.
Wigley, T.M.L. and Tu Qipu, 1983:  Crop-climate modelling using spatial
patterns of yield and climate:  Part 1, Background and an example from
Australia. Journal of Climate and Applied Meteorology 22, 1831–1841.
There never was a ""Part 2"".

"Obamacare brings record low for US health uninsured rate
CNBC
How low can Obamacare go?
Fewer than 1 in 10 Americans lacked health insurance in 2015, the first time ever in the nation's history that the uninsured rate has fallen so low, and a clear sign of Obamacare's impact.
The U.S. uninsurance rate fell to 9.1 percent last year, according to data released Tuesday by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
It was the first time the percentage of people without some form of health coverage has gone into single digits, and a 2.4 percentage point drop from 2014.
The number of people uninsured in 2015 was 28.6 million, which was 7.4 million fewer than 2014, according to the CDC.
Since 2011, when the uninsured rate stood at 15.1 percent, that rate has fallen 6 full percentage points, according to the CDC's National Health Interview Survey.
Obamacare began going into full effect in 2014, which was the first year that people could have private health insurance plans purchased on government-run marketplaces. That was also the first year that nearly all Americans were obligated to have some form of health insurance or face a possible tax penalty.
Before that, the Affordable Care Act had for the first time allowed adults under the age of 26 to stay on their parents' health plans, which was another factor that has played a role in driving down the uninsured rate.
A third factor in bringing down the uninsured rate has been the expansion of Medicaid benefits in a majority of states to cover many more poor adults than had been eligible under that joint federal-state health insurance program before the ACA became law.
The Obama administration has said more than 20 million Americans have gained health insurance coverage since the ACA became law in 2010.
The new report Tuesday was warmly greeted by the Obama administration, which last week lost a key court decision that, if upheld, could damage the Obamacare program.
A federal court judge ruled that the administration violated the law by giving insurers money, without congressional approval, to offset the cost of covering subsidized out-of-pocket health costs of many Obamacare customers.
The administration also has been dealing with a flurry of news stories detailing possibly steeper Obamacare rate hikes for 2017, and the departure of some insurers from various markets across the nation.
Sylvia Burwell, secretary of health and human services, said, ""Today's report is further proof that our country has made undeniable and historic strides thanks to the Affordable Care Act.""
""The report documents the progress we've made expanding coverage across the country,"" Burwell said.
""Meanwhile, premiums for employer coverage, Medicare spending and health-care prices have risen at exceptionally slow rates. Our country ought to be proud of how far we've come and where we're going,"" she said.
The CDC's survey found that among adults aged 18-64, the percentage who were uninsured decreased from 16.3 percent in 2014 to 12.8 percent last year.
""A corresponding increase was seen in the percentage having private coverage, from 67.3 percent to 69.7 percent, respectively,"" the report said.
""Among children aged 0-17 years, the percentage who were uninsured decreased from 5.5 percent in 2014 to 4.5 percent in 2015,"" the report said.
""Among those under age 65, the percentage with private coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace [the federal Obamacare exchange HealthCare.gov] or state-based exchanges increased from 2.5 percent (6.7 million) in the fourth quarter of 2014 to 3.4 percent (9.1 million) in the fourth quarter of 2015,"" according to the CDC.
The report said that In 2015, adults between the ages of 25 and 34 were more than twice as likely as adults aged 45 to 64 to lack health insurance coverage - 17.9 percent compared with 8.8 percent.
""In 2015, 27.7 percent of Hispanic, 14.4 percent of non-Hispanic black, 8.7 percent of non-Hispanic white, and 7.9 percent of non-Hispanic Asian adults aged 18-64 lacked health insurance coverage at the time of interview,"" the report said.
""Significant decreases in the percentage of uninsured adults were observed between 2013 and 2015 for Hispanic, non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, and non-Hispanic Asian adults,"" the report said.
""Hispanic adults had the greatest percentage point decrease in the uninsured rate between 2013 and 2015,"" falling from 40.6 percent to 27.7 percent, according to the report.",Placeholder,Placeholder explanation
"Hi all,
Think it'd be a good idea for us to hit the Trump/Ryan joint statement, and get our perspective in stories. Drafted something below.
DNC National Press Secretary Mark Paustenbach issued the following statement:
""Donald Trump and Speaker Ryan didn't have to issue a joint statement for the American people to know that they are on the same page and believe in the same dangerous and divisive agenda.  The fact of the matter is that despite some personal disagreements, they both support the old Republican playbook of cutting taxes for the rich at the expense of middle-class families, they both oppose measures like equal pay and paid family leave, and they both support reckless policies that would only to drag America back into a recession. We simply can't afford to go back to losing 800,000 jobs a month as the last Republican president left office.""

"Hi Peck et al,
Thanks for your note about the Africa borehole reconstructions, along
with the correspondence with Jason Smerdon. In my e-mail to you on
April 18,2006 I had indicated that the African work was unpublished.
However, I had forgotten that the Nature paper by Huang, Pollack and
Shen (Temperature trends over the past five centuries reconstructed
from borehole temperatures, Nature 403, pp 756-758, 2000) actually
showed the reconstructions for both southern Africa and Australia as
bar graphs of century-long changes in Figure 3 of that paper. The
figure displaying both the Africa and Australia borehole
reconstructions that appears in the FAR draft (Figure 6.12? or was it
6.11?) shows temperature vs. time for five centuries, a display that
differs from the bar-graphs in the Nature paper only in format, not
data.
Inasmuch as there have been no additions to the datasets since that
paper, it seems that we can correctly say that the reconstructions for
southern Africa and Australia have both been published in the Nature
(2000) paper. There is nothing ""wrong"" or outdated with either of those
reconstructions. We have, in addition, a newer and more expansive paper
about Australia alone (discussing the same reconstruction as appeared
in the Nature paper), now in press in the Journal of Quaternary
Science.  This paper was already mentioned in the e-mail of April 18,
2006, which I will paste at the end of this message.
Other questions?
Cheers,
Henry

Hi Keith (and Peck and Eystein),
I have recently been sent the current draft of the IPCC FAR by the US
Global Change
Research Program, asking for comments on the draft. This is the first
time I have seen
this product since we were feverishly exchanging e-mails in February.
Let me call to your
attention some small but not insignificant corrections to be made to
the next draft.
Page 6-33, Section 6.6.1.2, line 22.  The title of this section (in
italics) should be
changed to ""What do ground surface temperature reconstructions derived
from subsurface
temperature measurements tell us?""
Page 6-33, lines 49 and 52, there is a reference (Smerdon et al., in press).
This paper has now been published, so substitute ""2006"" for ""in press"",
and in the list
of references the citation should include the following:
J. Geophys. Res. 111, D07101, doi:10.1029/2004JD005578
Page 6-34, lines 43 and 44. This section is dealing with the southern
hemisphere. The
sentence ""...these both indicate unusually warm conditions prevailing
in the 20th century
(Pollack and Smerdon, 2004)""  , and the reference therein, are both incorrect.
The ground surface temperature changes over the last 500 years DO NOT
indicate unusually
warm conditions prevailing in the 20th century in Australia and
southern Africa. This is
because the unusually warm conditions developed late in the century,
after most of the
boreholes had already been logged.  What the borehole reconstruction
for Australia does
show is very good correspondence with the Cook et al (2000)
reconstruction for Tasmania
and the Cook et al. (2002) recon for New Zealand. The Australia work is
described in a
manuscript “Five centuries of Climate Change in Australia: The View
from Underground” by
Pollack, Huang and Smerdon now under review in the Journal of
Quaternary Science. The
Africa work is unpublished.
Is this e-mail to you sufficient to activate these changes? Or should I
submit these
comments to the US Government Review Panel? If I am to submit to the
latter, they require
all comments to be filed by May 9.
Cheers,
Henry

"Hello Jonathan, Keith, and Eystein:
I want to make a reminder about the embargo for release of the WRA Science comment article.  Please do not disseminate this article to anyone else, or discuss it publically until it is actually published, which I know Science wants to do soon.  I still believe citation is appropriate, and I have asked for clarification on this from the editors.  I will let you know what/if I hear from them.
FYI, this issue is also related to the NAS committee looking into last millenium surface temperature reconstructions this week, as I think you are aware.  Today, the NAS staff person working with this committee said he talked to Jesse Smith of Science about this article, who mentioned he could say nothing, but referred the staff person to me.  I was not really sure what this meant, and so I did not say anything specific on this myself, to ensure that I would not be in conflict with the embargo.  That is where it stands in that arena for now.
As you saw in the message from Steve Schneider that I copied to you, however, there is no embargo of any kind on use of the Climatic Change article.

Okay....Catchup unseen is something that I don't use often, but i can

"*         I feel good tomorrow if turnout is high, message is resonating
*         disputes that HRC has 2.7 million more votes because he doesn't think all caucus states have been counted
*         do you believe person who has most votes/delegates will be nominee?
o   I believe that this campaign is about the message
o   if we're behind in pledged delegates, it's very hard for us
o   we're the stronger campaign in taking on Trump or any republican, and Democrats care about that more than anything
o   superdelegates voted for HRC before I even announced, those people have a right to rethink decision that they made
*         how hard will you press that case?
o   issue is 5 states tomorrow, 10 states including largest in country
o   going to talk about middle class decline etc
*         you got hit for saying poor people don't vote
o   Clinton campaign has a Super PAC, 30 people on the internet making a big deal of everything I saw
o   low income people not voting in large numbers, I want that to change
*         what have you succeeded / failed at in turning out voters who don't vote
o   it's very difficult
o   so many middle class people turn on the TV, see nothing being talked about that improves their life, see Congress talking about tax breaks for billionaires, candidates taking millions from special interests
*         John Fetterman in PA endorsed you, has similar ideas, you haven't endorsed him or anything
o   I don't know much about him, etc
*         you built this movement, raised more than anyone
o   HRC has raised more, we don't have a Super Pac
*         campaigns like yours have faded away in the past, what would you do after?
o   it'll be a lot easier to mobilize / endure if I'm elected president
*         will you encourage your supporters to vote for HRC if you don't win nomination?
o   we're not a movement where I can snap my fingers and tell you what to do, you make your decisions yourself
o   if we lose and HRC wins, it's incumbent upon her to tell people who have serious misgivings about her Wall St $, etc, that she thinks the US should take on private insurance companies and pass Medicare for all, tuition free public colleges, she's going to have to explain to millions of young people that climate change is not going to be solved by incrementalism, pass a carbon tax.
o   incumbent upon HRC to present an agenda for working class, not just wealthy
*         Tim Robbins, Rosario Dawson have said things-what role do *you* have if HRC in nominee
o   good question, I work with GOP in Senate, have seen what they do in the House
o   GOP has moved so far to the right, unrecognizable, don't believe in climate change, want to end ACA
o   I will do everything in my power to make sure no Republican gets into the WH
*         how will you make sure you can implement CIR where undocumented immigrants like my parents aren't treated as second-class citizens
o   many are exploited now, by employers, living in shadows, I believe we need CIR
o   I will use exec powers if Congress don't act to make your parents safe
o   I disagree with Obama, will end deportations
*         how will you actually work with Congress
o   actually passed more amendments with Republicans than anyone else
o   passed comprehensive vets legislation with bipartisan support
*         OFA didn't do a whole lot, what could you do?
o   I talked to Obama about this, it is tough
o   President can help bring ordinary people together in grassroots, pressure Congress
o   because Obama is such a decent guy, he actually believed he could negotiate in good faith with Republicans-he was wrong, they never had any intention of doing so, it took Obama years to learn that. he knows it now. I will know that when I get there
*         soda tax opposition, we have a lot of constraints, so what would you do to fund pre-school?
o   I believe absolutely, priority is to establish high quality pre-K in every state
o   at time of massive income inequality, soda tax hurts the poor the most
o   it has to be funded in a progressive way
*         collateral consequences to incarceration
o   we should be embarrassed by how many people we have in jail
o   [mass incarceration platform]
*         voting for crime bill mistake?
o   this question has been asked literally a million times
o   it had bad provisions, it also had VAWA, ban on assault weapons
*         worst vote?
o   I shouldn't have voted to deregulate derivatives
o   HRC supported DOMA
*         under current law can US strike ISIS anywhere in the world?
o   no, I am confident we'll get new AUMF
o   I will not get us involved in perpetual warfare in Middle East
*         would you keep kill list as President?
o   we have right to defend ourselves, has to be done constitutionally
*         is what is being done now constitutional?
o   in general, yes
*         are 250 special operators to Syria permissible?
o   yes, bottom line is ISIS must be destroyed, not through American troops on ground
*         how will you fight for abortion access in every state?
o   totally support women's right to choose, expand planned parenthood
o   republicans totally hypocritical
*         SCOTUS TX law would gut Roe, how big a deal?
o   of course it's a big deal, why it goes without saying I'll nominee people to SCOTUS who will overturn CU and support Roe
*         HRC ticket / administration, or her on your ticket?
o   let me answer that exactly as you knew I would

"Hi Keith,
Of course, I agree with you. We both know the probable flaws in
Mike's recon, particularly as it relates to the tropical stuff. Your
response is also why I chose not to read the published version of his
letter. It would be too aggravating. The only way to deal with this
whole issue is to show in a detailed study that his estimates are
clearly deficient in multi-centennial power, something that you
actually did in your Perspectives piece, even if it was not clearly
stated because of editorial cuts. It is puzzling to me that a guy as
bright as Mike would be so unwilling to evaluate his own work a bit
more objectively.

Subject:	Enron Net Works 2002 Budget Process
The 2002 Enron Net Works budget will for the first time combine allocations to business units for four key services:  Enron Online, IT Infrastructure, Risk Management Operations and IT Maintenance and Development.  We are providing a level of detail for expense and capital spend that is greater than that provided in past years, and that will allow business units to make informed choices regarding the services that they receive.
We are meeting with individual business unit Offices of the Chair to review in detail the four service areas delivered through Enron Net Works.  Some of these meetings have been completed and more will occur between now and October 12.  Please keep the following points in mind as we work with you to finalize budget:
Enron Networks today is very different from this time last year.  Additions to the 2002 ENW budget are Operations for EA, EIM and EGM.  Operations, IT Maintenance and Development, and IT Infrastructure for EES and EBS have been included under the ENW umbrella for the first time in the  2002  budget as well.  The 2001 budgets for these functions were approved and included in individual business units last year.   Any comparison of ENW's 2002 versus 2001 budget must be appropriately adjusted for these organizational changes to be relevant.
For further detail for each business unit, ENW's 2002 expense and capital dollars are organized to mirror each business unit's lines of business (products or commodities) in order to create a transparent view at a more granular level of the costs involved in supporting each of the lines of business.
The detail that is being provided to business units for IT costs delineates licensing fees, system maintenance costs and new development costs.  Detail on each IT development project identifies the purpose, business sponsor, line of business, ""in progress"" or ""planned"" designation, expense and capital spend, system impacted, and estimated completion date.   In order to finalize IT project budgets, decisions will be required from the business units on which projects to undertake in 2002.
If you have questions about the ENW budgets as we are working with you to finalize them,  please call one of us.

Dear Dr. Jukes,
I'm afraid that, apart from the Bunn et al 2003 paper you mention, I
know of no other recent literature or data directly relevant to this
question. There is a graduate student here working on a dissertation
related to this, but neither their data nor any publications on them are
available at the moment. Two points concerning Graybill and Idso (1993):
1) I don't think the sour orange trees used in Sherwood Idso's
experiments were stripbark - where did this idea come from? 2) When
considering the use of upper forest border bristlecone pine (e.g. Sheep
Mountain, Campito Mountain, and similar sites mainly above 3100m in the
relevant region) as temperature proxies it would be a mistake to
discount Figure 3 in Graybill and Idso (1993) which is a comparison of a
ufb bristlecone pine chronology with a smoothed gridpoint reconstruction
from maximum latewood density in quite different trees provided by Keith
Briffa, one of your co-authors. I read this graph as confirmation of
LaMarche's interpretation of the ufb bcp records as having a ~bidecadal
temperature signal combined with an interannual precipitation signal, at
least before the 20th century. This is referred to Hughes and Funkhouser
(2003).

"Crew,
An article in the Washington Post mentions mental
health screening. The whole article is basically an
appeal for more money by the grubby mental health
industry.
See the article below. Write a letter to the editor
and send it to letters@washpost.com.
You can write what you want. My suggestion is just to
use this opportunity to forward any true message about
psychiatry and the mental health system. You can write
about the false labels, lack of science, the dangers
of drugs, the evils of screening.
Don't mention TeenScreen by name but you can use all
the standard messages to point out that screening
systems are bad.
Report compliance by email.

ARTICLE TEXT:
The Washington Post
July 18, 2006 Tuesday
HEADLINE: Many Face Long Waits for Mental Health Care;
Report on Growing Backlog of Low-Income Patients
Worries Supervisors
BYLINE: Bill Turque, Washington Post Staff Writer
The number of low-income adults in Fairfax County
waiting to be seen by a mental health professional has
nearly doubled in the last three months, a result of
unfilled positions in county clinics, a new report
says.
The Fairfax-Falls Church Community Services Board, the
agency that operates mental health, mental retardation
and substance abuse programs for the county, said 314
people were seeking an initial mental health screening
and assessment as of June 1, compared with 173 on
March 1.
The number of youths waiting for screening grew from
37 to 49 in the same period.
The Fairfax Board of Supervisors asked for the
progress report after Community Services Board
officials said at a March hearing that low-income
residents could wait as long as six months to begin
outpatient treatment. Those seeking spaces in group
homes can experience waits ranging from 10 months to
several years.
Board members expressed unhappiness with the growing
volume of people facing delays.
""That ain't in the right direction,"" said Supervisor
Penelope A. Gross (D-Mason), vice chairman of the
board's Human Services Committee. ""The thing that
really frosts me is that people can't even get
assessed.""
Agency officials say competition from the private
sector and other government agencies, combined with
the expense of housing in Fairfax, has hampered
recruitment of case managers, nurses and
psychotherapists. Since March, the agency has
intensified its advertising and increased some
starting salaries.
James A. Thur, executive director of the Community
Services Board, said the addition of seven staff
members who began working last week will begin to
improve services at outpatient clinics in Reston,
Annandale and the Alexandria area.
""We should be able to bring those wait lists down,"" he
said. Five vacancies remain, but beyond that, agency
officials said, the county will need to add positions
to deal with the increasing demand for treatment.
Gross said she was not convinced that more personnel
is the answer. ""Mostly what the [Community Services
Board] needs to do is roll its sleeves up and do
things differently,"" she said.
Mental health services in Virginia are delivered
through a network of such boards. Fairfax County
provides about 55 percent of the funding; Medicaid
pays 22 percent. Advocates have long criticized the
size of the state's contribution, which is about 12
percent.
Fairfax's problems reflect what experts say is a
national crisis in mental health care. Growth in
population and changes in the health-care industry and
in the medical complexity of patients' problems have
strained agencies virtually everywhere. More than 83
percent of the 11,000 Fairfax residents who received
mental health care in 2005 have household incomes
below $25,000 a year. Most are either uninsured or
underinsured.
""The system is under significant strain almost
everywhere because of years of neglect of the issues,""
Thur said.
Earlier this year, the National Alliance for the
Mentally Ill released a state-by-state report card on
governments' performance in treating the seriously
mentally ill. The organization gave a grade of D to
Virginia and the nation as a whole.
""Virginia's public system has suffered from years of
deep cuts,"" the report said, ""reductions that fell
disproportionately on local Community Services
Boards."" The survey ranked Virginia 30th in per capita
spending on mental health care.
Maryland and the District fared somewhat better in the
study, receiving a C-plus and a C, respectively.
Dotti McKee, a Fairfax resident and longtime mental
health advocate, said her 36-year-old son has paid a
steep price for the deficiencies of Virginia's system.
McKee said her son, who is severely paranoid and
schizophrenic, was released from a state mental
hospital this year but was told it would be two years
before he could be placed in a group home.
Living at home wasn't an option, McKee said, because
his mood swings were too much for her to handle.
As a stopgap measure, she found him a room in a
private home, but he had trouble maintaining his
prescription medicine, and his behavior became
erratic.
McKee said she called the Community Services Board to
see whether he could be admitted as an inpatient but
was told there was no room.
Finally, she said, she found him space in a county
homeless shelter, where a mental health worker keeps
an eye on him.
""To me, it's a godsend,"" she said.

I'm surprised to not find this phenomenon in Corlis. I could have sworn I
saw it there. He does have the somewhat similar dark sky between a rainbow
and a secondary bow. I personally have seen a rainbow enclosing a
semi-circle of darker sky.
I know I've read about pillars under the Sun and Moon elsewhere, but I can't
recall if they were reportedly dark or bright. I do know these sorts of
things are supposed to be quirks of optics not of the visual system. I'm
sorry I haven't got any answers, but a search through some books on
atmospheric optics ought to turn a few hints up.

"Hi,
Robust finding/uncertainty table is fine with me. Good job!
Here the 6.6 material from Bern. It includes an update on solar forcing, an
update on the section on compatibility of the GHG-proxz-forcing records, new
text for the sulfate aerosol figure, new text for the EMIC figure panel e) and
a proposed bullet for the last millennium modeling.
Will send an update of the ice core sulfate figure next week with one additional
curve from Antarctica and an updated figure caption. Otherwise, I think this is
all you need from me for 6.6. Will also hunt recent references for alpine cores
highlighted as missing.
Let me know if I missed something else for the last 2ka section.
- The solar subsection in 6.6.3 requires coordination with chapter 2 – Suggest
to send the text to Dorland and Lean as soon as agreed among us. Note that we
do not have an exec summary bullet on solar forcing – probably captured by chap
2
- should probably also send the para on sulfate aerosols to chap 2 for checking
consistency and cross-referencing
- Have tried to be brief and not to add much, have also suggested to delete
paragraphs.
- note new bullet proposed for exec summary on model results. Would be nice if
sufficient space, but  no strong feeling whether this should be included or
not; may be covered to some extent by the attribution chapter.

OK, noone has been tool-less for memory management for a LONG time. Most
systems you just add a flag and memory is tracked (that's how i've always
done it) or worst case yuo have to run it through one of the 2.3E7 tools
where you simply recompile and it it tells you where the leaks are.
Memory management is a non-issue for anyone that has any idea at all how the

Hi Phil:
There were inevitably a few things that needed to be changed in the
final version of the WA paper, such as the reference to the GRL paper
that was not published (replaced by the AW paper here), two or three
additional pointers to the AW paper, changed references of a
Mann/Rutherford/Wahl/Ammann paper from 2005 to 2007, and a some other
very minor grammatical/structural things.  I tried to keep all of this
to the barest minimum possible, while still providing a good reference
structure.  I imagine that MM will make the biggest issue about the very
existence of the AW paper, and then the referencing of it in WA; but
that was simply something we could not do without, and indeed AW does a
good job of contextualizing the whole matter.
Steve Schneider seemed well satisfied with the entire matter, including
its intellectual defensibility (sp?) and I think his confidence is
warranted.  That said, any other thoughts/musings you have are quite
welcome.

Subject: Heads up...
Republicans are looking for anything to mess with us on, so the Washington Examiner today at the White House briefing tried to bring me up as an example of someone who left the White House and then lobbied --- allegedly against the Administration's stated policy -- on Cuba.
The White House flagged it for me. They're not going to engage any further so I have to get back to the reporter and knock it down. To be clear, I didn't lobby during my consulting tenure. I provided public affairs services, strategic communications and press engagement. To the extent I was in touch with the White House, it was to be supportive of what the White House was already doing. Any lobbying was handled by my clients without me.
I'll keep you posted if anything else develops, but it is a bogus story. Here's the exchange from today's White House press briefing:
**Draft**
Susan, I'll give you the last one.
Q    Thank you, Josh.  Two things.  While you were out here in the briefing, it seems like CNN -- I'm looking on Twitter here so I can't be quite sure -- is reporting that U.S. officials are saying that the early belief is that a bomb brought the plane down -- the Egypt airplane down.  I'm wondering if you can confirm that they've found wreckage and whether that -- if you could confirm that U.S. officials are believing this is a bomb.
MR. EARNEST:  Well, I saw some of that reporting before I walked out here and I don't have an intelligence assessment to share at this point.
Q    Okay.  The second question is a little more complicated.  I'm wondering if -- I know that at the beginning of the administration the President really stressed the importance of not including lobbyists coming into the administration -- there were some exceptions.  But does he feel the same way about it when -- does he have the same concern when officials leave the administration?  That when they become lobbyists, do they need to sign up and be transparent about that disclosure?
MR. EARNEST:  Well, Susan, I don't have the details in front of me, but I know that some of the restrictions that the President put in place on his first day in office didn't just apply to individuals who might be considering employment in the federal government during the Obama administration; there were also commitments that incoming administration officials had to make about limiting their lobbying activities after leaving government.  And so there are prohibitions, or at least limitations, that apply to former Obama administration officials.
Q    Does the White House advise people leaving, do they remind them of that and their requirements?  Is there a process --
MR. EARNEST:  Yes, there is -- as part of the out-boarding process, you're reminded of the commitments that you've made on the way in that would limit your job prospects on the way out.  And look, many people have raised concerns about how historically there's been a revolving door between the federal government and K Street.  And the President's efforts, again, that he initiated on his first day in office were to close that revolving door, both in terms of the impact it has on people seeking to enter the government, but also based on restrictions that individuals committed to on their way out.
Q    It's not just K Street that these individuals are going to.  I'm wondering if the -- anybody left the White House that went to go on and lobby on behalf of engagement in Cuba, if -- and they're contacting administration officials, should they have registered to lobby?
MR. EARNEST:  Well, again, I assume -- it sounds now like you're asking about a specific case, and why don't we just walk through the details and -- help you understand how the rules might apply in a particular case.
Q    Sure.  Luis Miranda left the White House.  He went to the ** Group.  He did, from what I understand, engage in contacting the White House on that issue repeatedly, and from what I understand there's no lobbying disclosure records to show for that.  I have written about this, but we've talked about a lot -- there's been a lot of discussion about the Iran narrative this week, but there hasn't been a lot of discussion about the -- and the timeline -- and there hasn't been a lot of discussion about the Cuba timeline and what -- the transparency on those negotiations.  That's why I'm asking.
MR. EARNEST:  Okay.  Well, look, we can take a look and see if we can provide you some additional information.  It sounds like -- I'm not sure that any of that disclosure would apply to the administration, but we can take a look.
Q    To Luis Miranda specifically?
MR. EARNEST:  Well, he doesn't work here anymore.
Q    Right, so that's why --
MR. EARNEST:  So maybe you should go ask him.
Q    Right, I've tried to contact him and -- ** I've tried to contact him.
MR. EARNEST:  Okay.
Q    Is it important for the White House to have some level of -- on the Cuba issue to have had some level of surprise on that issue?  Or I mean, is it the President's right and the White House's right to -- and the State Department -- to engage in diplomacy behind the scenes before announcing a major initiative like trying to normalize relations with Cuba or another country?
MR. EARNEST:  Yes, I think that's entirely appropriate.  And that certainly has applied to other diplomatic breakthroughs that have been -- that the United States has benefitted from in just the last couple of years.  And when we were negotiating to secure the release of Americans who were being unjustly held in Iran, that was not something that we discussed extensively in the past.  When the United States was working behind the scenes with China to get them to make some significant commitments to fight carbon pollution in their country, that I think -- the results of those negotiations I think were a surprise to many in the public, but the United States enjoyed significant benefits as a result.
Those kinds of negotiations, that kind of diplomacy is often most effective when it's done behind the scenes, as you described it.
Thanks, everybody.

"Hi Ed and Keith - I hate to say it, but Richard's take on the
political aspects of the NRC vs. IPCC reports seem worth some extra
effort. Since you were both invited to speak with the NRC committee,
I would suggest that you both (together or separately) submit formal
comments asap. I don't know when the comment period starts or ends,
but I'm guessing you have to work fast. I'm also thinking that you
two might want to get out a peer-reviewed paper on the topic really
soon too. I worry that the hole will continue to deepen for
dendroclimate if you two don't act to clarify what we know/don't
know, and when it is safe (and why) to use dendroclimate data to
address the issue of long-term variation in temperature.
Please don't construe my suggestions or comments as pro/con dendro,
but rather just as someone who wants the truth - whatever it is - to
be communicated clearly, and as best we know it. But, I do think that
if Richard is suspect, dendro has a real problem. He doesn't have a
personal bias in this, and is clearly trying harder than most to
understand what's really going on with climate and the proxies.
Effort now might save time later.
Also, are you both going to be at the Swiss mtg in June? We really
have to get this all ironed out better before the next (last) draft
of the IPCC AR4.

Sure it is - it tends to bring out the people who let ""hysterical
right wing propaganda"" spew forth, while reaching for their gun
whenever a ""liberal"" enters the room.
my hysterical left wing ""propaganda"" is generally an emotional
reaction on a mailing list, not an organizaed attempt at converting
people's thinking through lies and distortion (as was the original
article).
Whereas your constant and predictable brandings of my postings are, to
my mind, a deliberate and reasoned  effort to reduce debate, and

Techs slump with Intel
With investors selling Intel shares before its post-market close earnings announcement, technology stocks dropped Tuesday.
Despite generally upbeat remarks on the economy by Fed Chair Alan Greenspan and news of a profitable quarter from Nextel Communications, CNET's Tech index slipped 12.4 points, or 1.25 percent, to 992.91. The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index fell 7.36 points, or 0.53 percent, to 1,375.26.
Worse-than-expected earnings from construction machinery maker Caterpillar helped depress broader markets. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 166.0 points, or 1.92 percent, to 8,473.1--for its seventh consecutive losing session. The S&P 500 shed 16.99 points, or 1.85 percent, to 900.94--another multi-year low.
Microsoft reveals media XP details
Microsoft on Tuesday gave an official name to an upcoming version of Windows XP that aims to make the PC a permanent part of the home entertainment center.
Originally code-named Freestyle, this entertainment version of Windows--which will go by the name Windows XP Media Center Edition--will appear on new PCs and PC hybrids in time for the holidays, the company revealed on Tuesday. With Windows Media Center, consumers will be able to use a TV remote control to catalog songs, videos and pictures, as well as check TV listings.MICROSOFT CORP 51.25 -1.06%
Intel layoffs possible
Chipmaker Intel may be on the verge of announcing massive layoffs or other cuts amid a slow market for personal computers, according to reports.
Intel CEO Craig Barrett is scheduled to speak to employees after stock markets close Tuesday, according to The Wall Street Journal. At about the same time, the chipmaker will discuss its second-quarter results on a conference call with analysts.INTEL CORP 18.36 -3.97%

Banc of America Securities begins coverage of Power Integrations with a ""market performer"" rating in tech notes 7/16/02
Analyst Douglas Lee says the maker of power supply integrated circuits is building a market niche with a more efficient and reliable technology than traditional approaches to converting AC-to-DC power supplies. He also notes Power Integrations is expanding its market with DC-to-DC power supply products, and says the firm's growth is based on converting today's power supplies to its more efficient technologies. As a result, the company doesn't need a boost in end-market demand to grow, Lee says. Although he sees a large, untapped market for Power Integrations and likes its long-term prospects, Lee suggests the stock is fairly valued. He believes shares of POWI are unlikely to rise much in the short term.POWER INTEGRATIONS 18.72 5.23%

French TV exec says Vivendi tapped him for CFO
A French television executive said on Tuesday he had been approached about taking over as finance chief at beleaguered media giant Vivendi Universal -- and acknowledged the job would be a ""challenge.""
Jacques Espinasse, chief operating officer at French satellite TV consortium TPS, has been cited by the French press as a candidate for the financial hot seat at Vivendi, which is grappling with cash and debt problems in the wake of the sacking earlier this month of chairman Jean-Marie Messier.VIVENDI UNIVERSAL 15.38 -5.06%

I've got a few quick Lockergnome-related notes for you today.
First, we'd really like to see you in August. I know that Jake, Chris and Randy have been signing off on their newsletters with those few words, and I'll join them. If you didn't experience Gnomedex last year, you missed, in the words of many industry insiders, ""The show of the year."" It was unlike any other computer conference I've ever attended. Unlike any conference I've attended, period, computer-related or not. While most such conferences are a huge hustle and hassle, Gnomedex was what computing and Lockergnome are all about - sharing useful information, gathering with like-minded enthusiasts, and learning to use your chosen computer to the fullest extent. No hustle. No hassle. No BS. For the minimal cost of registration, it would be hard to find a better weekend for geeks and wannabes alike. Add to that the schedule of luminaries presenting and attending and you've got the best deal on the planet for computer users. It's hard to believe we're less than a month away - I really do hope to see you there.
Another Lockergnome innovation has hit the newsstands - err, bookstores. That's right. Jake has release a FREE GnomeTome on ""Converting Vinyl LPs to CD."" Who'd have thought there were so many of you out there that are, well, my age and still in possession of those black slabs of aural heaven. I don't know if Jake's just lost his mind, or what, but free? Get outta here. Go ahead - ""Gnome"" our servers. Get you copy while you can. And while you're there, check out some of the other killer e-tip books in the GnomeTomes collection.
Have a great Tuesday.

Setting the Home Page in Konqueror
Konqueror, while a great browser, has taken a step in the direction of IE. Like IE, Konqueror is really an integrated web and file browser. You can use it equally well to view web pages and files on your system. It's been something of a hot debate whether this is actually the proper use of a browser. In fact, Galeon was written specifically to answer this question - it's a web browser and a web broswer only.
Regardless, it can be a bit annoying to punch the Home button on the Konqueror browser and end up in your /home/user directory. Have no fear, though. It's an easy change to make your actual web home page the home page in Konqueror.
Open Konqueror and select Settings from the toolbar. Select ""Configure Konqueror,"" and leave the default selection of ""File Manager"" as is. In the text box on the right half of the screen, you'll see a tilde in the ""Home URL"" text box. That just tells Konqueror to use the user's home directory as the home URL. Changing this to a web address will set that address as your home page. Select OK to close the window.
Taking it one step further, click on the Home button in your Konqueror browser to open your newly-configured web home page. Then, select ""Window"" and ""Save View Profile, 'Web Browsing.'"" This will futher save the URL and allow your the opportunity to save the window size when the browser opens.
Konqueror is more than just a web browser. But, it's not so tough to make it act like a pure web browser if you just know where to look.

Kernel Configuration - Part XII
Depending on who you talk to, RAID can stand for ""Redundant Array of Independent Discs"" or ""Redundant Array of Inexpensive Discs."" No matter. They both point to the same theory and practice in Linux; data storage redundancy. That's today's kernel configuration section - Multi-Device Support.
Let's talk first about the principles behind a RAID setup. RAID uses multiple discs for speed, increased data storage, or data redundancy. Fundamentally, there are 5 levels of RAID in Linux; Linear, RAID-0, RAID-1, RAID-4, and RAID-5.
Linear RAID uses two or more discs, appending data from one to another. In other words, when disc 1 is full, disc 2 steps in to store data. There is no redundancy in Linear RAID - only an increase in storage capacity. Further, there's no marked increase in data access speed because you're accessing one drive in the RAID array at a time.
RAID-0 ""stripes"" data across the RAID drives. Some data will be written to the first drive, some to the second, etc. Like Linear RAID, RAID-0 provides no redundancy. Because the data has been written in parallel across the drives, not all data exists on all drives. Lose a drive and your data is gone. RAID-0 will, however, decrease data access time. Your system will run more quickly.
RAID-1, unlike Linear and RAID-0, does provide data redundancy. This is the first level in which data is ""mirrored"" across the drives in the RAID array. All data that exists on one drive exists on all the others. RAID-1 requires at least two drives and they should be of equal size, otherwise, your overall RAID array will be the size of the smallest drive. Performance with RAID-1 can actually be slower than with a single drive or RAID-0, as all the data is written across multiple discs.
RAID-4 is, for the most part, pretty useless. It reserves one disc for parity information while striping the data across the others. This is much like Linear mode, with an additional disc thrown in for parity data. Parity data can be used to reconstruct and retrieve the data on the other drives, but this really isn't a redundant method of data storage. Consequently, RAID-4 is probably the least used of the RAID schemes.
RAID-5 is designed for 3 or more discs and provides both redundancy and speed. Like RAID-4, RAID-5 pays close attention to parity data. However, rather than reserving a device in the RAID array for this data, it's written across the array. Because the parity data is written across the array, data recovery can be accomplished fairly quickly. In fact, using a ""spare disc"" configuration will allow RAID-5 to reconstruct the data to the spare disc immediately after the failure of a drive. Because of it's increased speed and redundancy, RAID-5 is probably the most common setup for multiple storage devices.
With all that in mind, you'll need to make a choice in your kernel configuration. Do you have mutliple drives of the same size that you'd like to configure as a RAID array? The Multi-Device Support section of the kernel configuration will allow you to do this. In fact, you'll be able to set the RAID level, as well. Again, evaluate your needs and select the appropriate option.
Tomorrow, it's on to networking options in your kernel configuration.

Windows Apps in Linux?
Scribbled by Robert Nix
""Nice coverage but I don't give a flip about Office. OpenOffice is fine
for my needs.
""What I really want is to run Quicken (at least v.2001) which is the only
app keeping me running Windows (using vmware). I've tried Quicken on Mac
OS X and it is grossly inadequate and on Linux with Wine and have so far
been unsuccessful even using tips from
 I hope that GnuCash
will eventually support the online features I enjoy but that doesn't
help now.
""The reason I'm writing this is that I personally think Office products
are overrated for home users, at least now that there are several native

Important Unix Manpages
~m.hussmann/man/
Manpages are an important part of Linux use. Armed with the proper knowledge and manpage, there are few sticky situations in Linux that can't be solved quickly. Though they can be a bit cryptic at times, manpages are really a Linux newbie's best friend.
Important Unix Manpages is a compilation of help for situations that actually have little to do with programming. They're more human interface problems than machine interface problems. This page just points out that if life was like Linux, we'd all be a lot happier.

"Talks about Trump transition team in 3rd paragraph
Chris Christie On His Role As Transition Chairman For Donald Trump: ""But As Some Of You May Know About Presidential Transitions, The Chairman's Running The Show And I Will Do That And I Will Make The Major Decisions That Need To Be Made, Of Course In Consultation With The Candidate."" CHRISTIE: ""I'm honored to be asked by Donald to have the responsibility of putting together a plan that will carry his first 200 days in office and a plan that will help him to populate the 4,000 federal jobs he'll need to fill in a relatively short order if he were to become president. That's not something, none of that stuff can be done in 75 days between the election and the inaugural. And so we're going to begin work earnestly now that the announcement's been made and I've been asked. Listen, in terms of time, the fact is that in the beginning, there will be some decent time for me to put a good team together. But as some of you may know about presidential transitions, the chairman's running the show and I will do that and I will make the major decisions that need to be made, of course in consultation with the candidate."" [NJTV, 5/11/16
]
Chris Christie On Traveling Out-Of-State While Serving As Donald Trump's Transition Chairman: ""I've Always Been Able To Manage My Time Pretty Well And I Don't Think It Will Take Me Out Of State Much At All. Maybe To Washington D.C. Every Once In A While."" ""But in the end, a lot of the work will be done by men and women who will volunteer their time as traditionally has happened across the country to bring their expertise to bear on all the different issues that a new president would have to confront. So I can't give you an exact amount of time, Michael, but I've always been able to manage my time pretty well and I don't think it will take me out of state much at all. Maybe to Washington D.C. every once in a while."" [NJTV, 5/11/16

Christie: Today I'm pleased to announce that the growing health and solvency of our trust fund, which now has a positive balance of $1.8 billion will allow for yet another tax cut to be realized by our employers. We had announced just a few weeks ago a $200 million tax cut effective July 1. We're now announcing that we will increase that tax cut on July 1 by another $180 million making for a total tax cut of $380 million for our employers as of July 1.

Christie: I want to save Atlantic City. So does the Senate president. I would hope that the speaker would too. But if he's going to force Atlantic City to bankruptcy, that's going to be his call. I've done my job. I've said what I'd sign. And, by the way, when Sen. Sweeney and Assemblyman [Lou] Greenwald came out with a compromise, I said I'd be willing to look at it. But that wasn't good enough either. The only person who's not come to the table with anything, the reason he doesn't have a seat at the table? You got to bring something to the table. What's he brought, except defiance? So, I want to save Atlantic City, the Senate president wants to save Atlantic City and I think a majority of the state Legislature wants to. But speaker is bringing nothing to the table. Once again today he comes with nothing. Promised a vote today. He was going to get this thing passed. He didn't, again. So what's next now, Mr. Speaker? He can send out as many press releases as he wants blaming me but if I don't have anything on my desk to sign, and he can't point me to the inherent authority he says I have, well what am I supposed to do?
Christie: I'm honored to be asked by Donald to have the responsibility of putting together a plan that will carry his first 200 days in office and a plan that will help him to populate the 4,000 federal jobs he'll need to fill in a relatively short order if he were to become president.

Maybe to Washington D.C. every once in a while.
Aron: And Christie was asked whether becoming transition chair lessens his chances of being Trump's running mate. He said that's up to Donald, but he sounded like he wouldn't mind. I'm Michael Aron. Mary Alice, back to you.

I just wanted to close the loop on the question of deferring the $.7million UCU credit to 2002.  The last we talked, it was decided that we could not defer the credit because of cash target concerns.  If this is still the directive, we will see a positive variance to Third Current Estimate in October of $1.2 million.
Would you confirm that this is still our decision?  If so, we will include the earnings upside  in our Quarter Forecast next week.

Hi team,
The stakes will keep on getting higher and higher us as November approaches. For that reason, I'd like to clarify responsibilities for our weekend rotation so that we send out releases in a timely fashion - and not hours after they've been approved. If you have any questions about how to blast, please let Rachel and Jenna know before your weekend rotation.
Thx.
LEAD
*         Be within an hour of a computer for the entire weekend.
*         Set aside Sunday morning to coordinate with research and immediately send notes around after Sunday shows.
*         Take the lead on writing releases and pitching in a timely fashion.
*         Take the lead on moving all hits along, bumping for approval if need be.
*         Blast all releases and post them to Factivists.
*         If for some reason you have an emergency (for example: you are hit by a bus or your computer is fried) and you cannot be point to write and blast a release, you are in charge of communicating with your backup to ensure they can take your place. Don't just ignore your email-it's your responsibility to communicate with your backup.
*         Plan all social and personal activity accordingly. If you will be away from a computer for more than an hour, make sure your back up is available during that time.
*         Send articles around the slack group and comm_d throughout the weekend.
BACKUP
*         Be within an hour of a computer for the entire weekend.
*         If the lead has an emergency and is unable to fulfil their role, you must take point for writing releases, pitching, and blasting.
*         Stay in communication with your lead throughout the weekend to see how you can be helpful.
*         Send articles around the slack group and comm_d throughout the weekend.
BACKUP #2
*         If both the lead and the backup have an emergency, you are next in line to take point. This role will usually not be needed, but it is an extra precaution in the rare circumstance that the lead and backup are unable to fulfill their duties.
*         Only used a last resort and for legitimate excuses.

Don't just ignore your email-it's your responsibility to communicate with your backup.
*         Plan all social and personal activity accordingly. If you will be away from a computer for more than an hour, make sure your back up is available during that time.
*         Send articles around the slack group and comm_d throughout the weekend.
BACKUP
*         Be within an hour of a computer for the entire weekend.
*         If the lead has an emergency and is unable to fulfil their role, you must take point for writing releases, pitching, and blasting.
*         Stay in communication with your lead throughout the weekend to see how you can be helpful.
*         Send articles around the slack group and comm_d throughout the weekend.
BACKUP #2
*         If both the lead and the backup have an emergency, you are next in line to take point. This role will usually not be needed, but it is an extra precaution in the rare circumstance that the lead and backup are unable to fulfill their duties.
*         Only used a last resort and for legitimate excuses.

Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.
I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.",Placeholder,Placeholder explanation

Isn't it just basically a mixture of beaten egg and bacon (or pancetta,
really)? You mix in the raw egg to the cooked pasta and the heat of the pasta
cooks the egg. That's my understanding.

We'll go with what we have then - Eystein's

Professor Briffa,
I have written a couple of blogs on the current report by Steve
McIntyre that the data used by Mann to ""prove"" the hockey Stick was fabricated. This & the
following day's
[1]
.
As a result I have received this email from somebody I am not aquainted with throwing
the entire blame on you. This seems improbable to me & possibly an alarmist damage
limitation exercise. If you wish to comment I would be happy for you to do so.
""Please note: Steve McIntyre's post concerns work by climate scientist Keith Briffa and
not Michael Mann. You will probably wish to correct your post.
Cheers
Avisame""
I have posted this as an update with my reply:
""My understanding is that while Briffa did the tree ring measurement, Mann, in his paper,
chose to choose 12 atypical tree rings out of at least 34 to fabricate the global warming
trend. My assumption is that Mann is responsible for fabrications in his own paper & that
this is a damage limitation exercise. I am open to correction on this & indeed have emailed
Mr Briffa to see. ""

We received this through our enquiries desk.  I assume that you are aware of this person,
including those copied on the message.
If we are to respond, it would be to indicate that there are multiple sources of supporting
evidence and that we continue to place our confidence in the international scientific
assessment process.  This confidence has proven to be well placed.

Subject: RE: Please take note of potetially serious  allegations of scientific
'fraud' by CRU and Met Office
Dear Stephanie
I expect that a great deal of UKCIP work is based on the data provided by CRU (as
does the work of the IPCC and  of course UK  climate policy). Some of this, very
fundamentally, would now seem to be open to scientific challenge, and may even face future
legal enquiries. It may be in the interest of UKCIP to inform itself in good time and
become a little more 'uncertain' about its policy advice.
Perhaps you can comment on the following and pass the allegations made on to the
relevant  people.
It is beyond my expertise to assess the claims made, but they would fit into my
perception of the whole 'man-made global warming' cum energy policy debate. I know several
of the  people involved personally and have no reason to doubt their sincerity and honour
as scientists, though I am also aware of their highly critical (of IPCC science) policy
positions.
I could also let you have statements by Steve McIntyre and Ross McKitrick. Ross
McKitrick currently teaches at Westminister Business School and who is fully informed about
the relevant issues. He recently addressed a meeting of about 50 people in London.

"For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA,  a ""single sum distribution,"" in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement.
Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant.  A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock.
Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock.  The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election.
Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan.",Placeholder,Placeholder explanation

I am in Birmensdorf now and will stay here until March 20s.
As far as I know Stepan Shiyatov has to translate the proposal
into Russian because of this year there are two possibility to get grant.
The one is just INTAS competition and other is joint INTAS-RFBR (Russian
Foundation for Basic Researches) ones with the same requirements and
grant amounts. For second one we have to submit russian version to RFBR.
If proposal will reject by RFBR it will be automatically submit for
INTAS competition.

Subject: RE: S.E. Asia trip
You can't drive to Hoi An - it is approx.. 12 hours 34 minutes.Â  You would fly to Danang - flight time is 1 hour and 15 minutes
So if you wanted to do that you would go from Hanoi to Danang- visit Hoi an and then back to the airport and fly to Nah Trang to visit the Amanoi Resort...
Would you rather go to Hoi An and replace it instead of going to Amanoi?
Â
See below â some suggestions of what to do when in Hoi An
Â
Between the 17th and 19th centuries, Hoi An was a prosperous trading port. Today, this World Heritage-listed ancient town boasts well-preserved buildings, pedestrianized streets and unique cuisine, allowing visitors a glimpse of its illustrious past. The narrow lanes are ideal for a guided walking tour. There is plenty to visit including the old merchantâs houses with influences from Chinese, Japanese and Vietnamese architecture; the 400-year-old Japanese Covered Bridge; the Assembly Hall of the Chaozhou Chinese Congregation with outstanding wood carvings; and the colorful market with stalls brimming with local specialties including silk, which can be turned into fashionable garments within a day or two.
Â
In the 16th and 17th century Thanh Ha was a thriving village. It was Thanh Ha villagers who made the bricks, tiles and floor slabs for the old buildings in Hoi An ancient town. Although there have been various changes of time and economic difficulties, the local craftsmen in this pottery village always make their endeavor to preserve the traditional craft inherited from their ancestors. Enjoy a 40min boat ride on Thu Bon river to this pottery village.Â  Walk around the zigzagging alleys, interact with the villagers and try your hand at making a vase. You might want to support the local community by buying one of their products. Drive back to town.
Â
Let me know if you want to go to both or to Hoi An after Hanoi.
Â
Any news about your possible work trip to Jakarta?Â  Is it looking likely or not?

Hi a.pelliccione,
Hope all is well with you and the family. I
know you reached out to me last month looking for a good investment amid
this crazy market. I must tell you it has been very hard to find
something solid. Theres very few hidden gems out there and I honestly
didnt even think I would be able to find something. That being said the
best Ive been able to find is
RNBI
and when I say best, it really seems to be a god send. I told a few of
my other clients about it last month as it seemed pretty cheap and it
has gone up by more than 50% since. Im giving you a heads up on
RNBI
because I spoke
with a few of my colleagues and they agree that it will hit a dollar
some time in the coming weeks. Dont tell anyone you hear this from me
please we're suppose to keep it on the down low. The company operates in
the legalhemp industry, apparently the sector has been going nuts since
colorado and washington made the stuff legal and apparently
RNBI
is going to
announce some big news soon. Not sure what it is but my source is
usually pretty spot on.
Take care and let me know if you need
anything else. Ill keep you posted if I have some more news.

Visithcharoen,
Can you show me where in the compliance document we have to support the
2 points? Moreover for the 2nd point, we have no control over the ip address
(dynamic or static) and what ports are allowed as its allocated by the
service provider.
To summarize, these 2 ""issues"" you mentioned are not even issues.
The 1st point I can accept it as a feature request and we are planning
to support it Q1 or Q2 next year. The 2nd point is a constraint from the
service provider. As demonstrated, there are also physical infection or
infection over Wifi which the customer can use.

"The Disappearing Alliance
By Dale Franks 10/08/2002
For over two generations, the countries of Western Europe have been our
closest allies. We stood beside each other through the darkest days of the
Cold War as partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. We
celebrated with them over the fall of the Soviet Empire and the liberation
of Eastern Europe from the yoke of communism.
Tragically, a generation from now, we may be bitter adversaries.
Europe has increasingly fallen under the spell of a political ideology that
Hudson Institute scholar John Fonte has termed ""progressive
transnationalism"". The key doctrines of this form of post-communist
progressivism contain some fairly pernicious ideas. Among these are the
deconstruction of nationalism, the promotion of post-nationalist ideas of
citizenship (i.e. a ""global"" citizenry), a redefinition of democracy, and
the pooling of national sovereignty into multinational groups such as the
United Nations.
The European Union, itself a multinational organization built through the
pooling of sovereignty by European nations, is post-democratic. While there
is a European Parliament, the EU's power resides mainly in the unelected
European Commission (EC) and its unelected President, who face few limits
to their power. Instead of a limited, consensual form of government, where
elected representatives promulgate constitutional laws, the EU has an
appointed, oligarchic executive, along with a large attendant bureaucracy,
whose orders are not constitutionally limited in any real sense. Moreover,
the EU has been unwilling to accept the democratically expressed wishes of
the people themselves when those wishes conflict with the results desired
by the EU's political elite. Both the EC and the European Court of Justice
regularly overturn the national laws of democratically elected EU member
governments. This is a step backward in Europe's political development.
European criticism of America is on the rise, and the European list of
complaints about America is a long and growing one. They dislike the fact
that our republican system of government is not based on proportional
representation. They hate the fact that our citizens own guns. They despise
the fact that we execute murderers. They resent the fact that our economy
is so large, and that Americans consume so much. They also resent?and fear
- the fact that we have the ability to project American power anywhere
in the world.
On August 9, 2002, Adrian Hamilton wrote a column in the UK's Independent
newspaper, in which he identified the US as a rogue state who should be
restrained, perhaps by a European military invasion, followed by a decade
or so of occupation. Fortunately, the article is satirical not because it
exaggerates the way European progressives view the US, but rather because
the impotence of European military power makes the idea of an invasion of
the US literally fantastic.
At least, for now.
Despite the tongue-in-cheek nature of this editorial, however, the fact
remains that America is increasingly viewed this way by the European
intellectual and political elite.
The Europeans actively desire a world where the United Nations keeps in
check the activities of sovereign states. Because they have built such a
system in Europe, they feel it's valid for the rest of the world. America,
however, is the biggest obstacle to such a system. The Europeans cannot
understand why America places a higher value on the ethos of national
sovereignty and limited, consensual, and constitutional government, than it
does on compliance with international ""norms."" They view all departures
from such norms as aberrant. Because the UN member states all have an equal
vote in prescribing international norms, they assume that, since the
process is ostensibly legitimate, the results must be as well. The trouble
with this idea, of course, is that it gives the views of non-democratic,
authoritarian states the same weight as those of free, democratic
societies. It sanctifies the process, with no regard to the actual results.
Thus, they are unable to make any moral distinction between the US refusals
to join in a given international effort because we wish to preserve the
liberty of our citizens, and similar refusals from Iraq because its
dictator wishes to maintain his firm grip on power. Our repeated references
to the US Constitution, and our unwillingness to bypass its provisions to
comply with international norms, are incomprehensible to them. They assume,
therefore, that our refusal is based on arrogance, rather than on a
commitment to
constitutional rights.
None of this bodes well for the future of Euro-American friendship, or
cooperation. If the Europeans continue to reject traditional liberalism in
favor of the new progressivism, their criticism of the US will rise, while
their tolerance of our differences will fall. Obviously, in such a
political atmosphere, the opportunities for conflict will inevitably
increase.
That thought is frightening enough. Even more frightening, however, is the
thought that such a conflict might be averted by our own acceptance of the
new ideology of transnational progressivism.

Subject: For research: This Week on the Campaign Trail
It's been a disastrous week for the GOP. Now that Ted Cruz and John Kasich have both dropped out of the race, Donald Trump is the Republican Party.
Problems for Republicans extend far beyond the Cleveland convention, which many top GOP leaders have already vowed to avoid. With Trump as their nominee, any remaining hope Republicans had of concealing their true colors is gone. Party leaders shouldn't be surprised though - this was a crisis of their own making. For years, the Republican Party has elevated extreme voices, using divisive campaigns that sought to exploit unfounded fears for political gain. Now they're stuck with the most reckless, dangerous and divisive nominee in modern history.
In every primary contest, Republican voters continue to report in exit polls that their primary has been divisive - in some cases, more than half report they feel betrayed by their own party. Meanwhile, in poll after poll, Democratic voters are reporting that our primary has energized the party and that they're enthusiastic about our candidates. It's clear that the enthusiasm gap favors Democrats.
From now until Election Day in November, Democrats will hold Trump accountable for his offensive rhetoric and dangerous ideas. We're fighting for the American people, and for the values of inclusion, hard work, dignity and opportunity for all. Looking to our convention in Philadelphia, we will not only emerge united, but we will nominate the next President of the United States.
Supreme Court Vacancy
It's been 51 days of Republican obstruction
since President Obama nominated Chief Judge Garland to the Supreme Court, passing the average amount of time it takes the Senate to hold a hearing on a nominee. While Republicans continue to avoid doing their jobs, Senators like Chuck Grassley have admitted it would be a ""gamble"" to allow Trump to fill the Supreme Court vacancy. And the American public agrees: 62% of voters don't trust Trump to nominate a new Supreme Court justice. If Americans agree that Donald Trump lacks the judgement to nominate a Supreme Court justice, when will the GOP? Job well done, Senator McConnell
.
The Campaign Trail
Trump clinched his party's nomination, but something's not quite right... Will any former GOP nominees or presidents endorse Trump
? So far, it's looking pretty bleak. Mitt Romney, John McCain and the former Bush Presidents still have yet to throw their support behind Trump. But things got especially awkward when Paul Ryan, the highest ranking House Republican and chair of the Republican National Convention, said that he cannot endorse
Trump. But Ryan, with his fellow Republicans, paved the way for Trump.
From flip-flopping on campaign funding
to calling the National Enquirer ""professionals
,"" Trump also reminded us this week that he's about as knowledgeable
about foreign policy as Sarah Palin, and all he knows is what's on the internet
.
WATCH
Even the former Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates took to the airwaves
to question Trump's grasp of foreign policy, saying Trump is someone ""who doesn't understand the difference between a business negotiation and a negotiation with sovereign powers."" Gates' comments are a reminder that Trump clearly lacks the judgment, experience, and temperament to be our next commander-in-chief.
The New York Times described what Trump's first 100 days as president would look like, noting, ""many Americans are scared and anxious about the idea of him in the Oval Office."" Here is a brief summary

2000 new infections daily, with no sign of letup at press time. The
British security firm MessageLabs estimates that 1 in every 300
e-mail messages holds a variation of the Klez virus, and says that
Klez has already surpassed last summer's SirCam as the most prolific
virus ever.
And some newer Klez variants aren't merely nuisances--they can carry
other viruses in them that corrupt your data.

Subject: For approval: AKD deadline emails
Hi all - A couple of emails to send from Amy below to kick off our monthly deadline push. Let me know if you have any flags, and thanks.
-v1(EJB)-
Sender: Amy K. Dacey
Subject:
Friend -
I'm sure you've been hearing everywhere from cable news to the folks in line next to you at your grocery store just how unprecedented this election is and that we've never seen anything like it.
Part of that is true - Donald Trump is an unprecedentedly unqualified candidate for a major party's nomination for president. His lack of knowledge about any type of policy and lack of interest or willingness to listen or learn is certainly unique. His behavior and temperament on the campaign trail are definitely unlike anything I've seen.
But here's what's not different - the fact that we have supporters like you willing to do what it takes between now and Election Day to elect Democrats who share our values and will fight for us every day. Just like you did when we elected President Obama in 2008 and again in 2012, and in so many other elections, we are counting on you to go the extra mile, whether that's literally by going door to door around your city, making phone calls, sharing the latest news on social media, or checking to make sure everyone you know is registered and has a plan to vote.
It also means digging a little deeper to help us raise the money we need to make sure Democrats have the resources that are absolutely necessary to win in November. Every dollar counts when it comes to stopping Trump and the rest of his pals in the GOP - can I count on you to pitch in $10 or more before our end-of-month deadline next week?

Thanks for all you do, NAME. We're counting on you to help us get this done.
All the best,
Amy

Subject: Be optimistic, NAME
Friend --
We're 63 days <-- this is good assuming email is going out tomorrow away from the start of our convention in Philadelphia, where we'll nominate the 45th President of the United States -- and Democrats have every reason to feel optimistic about the future of our party.
For starters, we have two outstanding candidates running for president. And even as the Republicans' presumptive nominee starts to gather support from GOP leaders like Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell and special-interest groups like the NRA, the truth is that Donald Trump is the most unqualified presidential candidate in the history of modern American politics. So I feel pretty darn good about either of our candidates defeating Trump in November.
Secondly and most importantly, NAME, we have you.
You're one of millions of Democrats from all corners of the country who refuse to let Republicans take us backwards. So much of the success that we've achieved happened because grassroots supporters like you stepped up in moments like this and did whatever it took so we could elect Democrats up and down the ballot -- and with all the progress we've made under President Obama at stake in this election, your support has never been more important than it is right now. That's why I'm asking for your help today.
LINKS
I'm confident that by the time Election Day comes, we will have gotten our message out so that every American understands how important putting another Democrat in the White House is to keeping our country moving forward. But we can't take anything for granted, NAME -- so before our end-of-May deadline, pitch in $10 or more to help make sure we beat Donald Trump and the Republicans supporting him in November.

Thank you so much, NAME.
All the best,

"Hey, following up on our conversation, was hoping you could put in a good word for my DNC housing request. I am, now that you've mentioned it!, quite worried that I won't make it off the waitlist - let alone be able to find convenient housing at this point in a 10 mile range.
Thanks in advance!
