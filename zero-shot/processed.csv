"Hi everyone
I have been through the ideas and offer a few (aptly non organised) comments. First Phil is
away and will not be able to comment until later.
First, the project needs more explicit focus. The call will focused on natural variability
. We are offering a detailed analysis of the variability of climate in the Alpine Region
that focuses on CLIVAR timescales - basically very high resolution and not extending much
beyond a few centuries. The project incorporates instrumental , model and palaeodata . The
inter-relationships between these will be studied to gain an understanding of the nature
and mechanisms of the climate variability - but is this enough. I feel it needs to be
linked with a strong element of understanding the range of social/economic impacts of this
variability.
Perhaps looking at aspects such as avalanches, forest damage, floods, tourism etc.? I
merely put this out as a straw man . I feel the EC are putting a lot of emphasis on this
aspect of research and incorporating research and researchers in these or similar areas
will be a big plus.
As for the specific points in the brainstorming document -
The Dendro aspect :
I think it is essential to update the Alpine tree-ring chronologies that are available .
This is because they are a proven asset but many questions regarding tree-productivity (in
relation to observed 20th century climate variability) simply can not be addressed without
doing this. Many were collected over 20 years ago. The additional data would then allow new
processing techniques to be employed and vital questions concerning the changing responses
of tree-growth to explored. The most efficient way to do this is to involve several groups
working in the Alps , (Thank you for sending the Thesis by Giorgio Strumia which is
certainly a very impressive piece of work) I would think Rupert Wimmer's group and the
Birmensdorf group would be ideal (Fritz Schweingruber has retired but Jan Esper has joined
them in his place - I can ask them to be involved but this depends on what the group here
think are the priorities and how much we see as the overall budget and institutional
allocations). I should say here that I think we would require money for a single person who
could , if it is  agreed, work on aspects of tree-ring processing and relationships with
climate in association with the other tree-ring groups, but also work with the climate and
model data , especially with a view to exploring the statistical inter-relationships and
dynamical associations between the different climate data sets. There is also the French
tree-ring group at Marseille? Perhaps though not all need to partners - ALSO I am thinking
of putting together a European Tree-ring project (or suggesting it as part of a large
European integrated proxy study of Holocene variability) so if this happened there could be
a link between it (involving some of the groups mentioned) and this proposal. The Swiss
might be interested to produce selected site tree-ring density/updating which I think would
be very valuable and I will speak to them without commitment as you ask.
As for some of the climate analysis possibilities mentioned, I very much like the ideas of
detailed ,local climate comparisons with the larger CRU (and CRUder!) data. We are very
interested in the association between time dependence in the relationships between
circulation changes and changes in Temp. and Prec. Also changes in the nature of climate
seasonality , and also extreme events (frost frequency , drought, intense rainfall). The
detailed analyses of these characteristics also compliments the interpretational work on
the tree-ring and glacier mass balance (and socio economic foci) data.
As for the glacier work - is not a huge effort already going into this? I think it is
important but does it fit as well ? The work proposed would have to be distinguished from
other ongoing efforts - though I do like the idea of linking the geomorphological evidence
of past glacier change (moraines , pro-glacial sediment data?) with reconstructed glacier
volume changes , where the reconstructions are based on new long instrumental data , and
palaeodata (temp. and precip.) used to drive a model of the glacier volume.  Our German (or
Julie) colleagues can point to such work based on GCM output . My colleague here (Sarah
Raper) has also done this sort of work but using a very simple model to estimate past
Storglaciaren (in Sweden) volume changes  and her results imply that these models must be
forward driven and not based on simple regression analysis using temperature and
precipitation to estimate past mass balance.
The future aspects of the discussion are important - and it is true that the previous EC
call dealt with modelling and scenarios of future changes. Here, I believe the use of
models should be strictly limited to understanding natural /current variability and change.
There is no benefit in going for a 2 year project - I strongly urge 3. I also would find a
meeting difficult. I am away from 17-29 July, and 11-25 August, and in meetings during
7-10th July and 26-31st August.
Phil will be back here next week and will no doubt comment in more detail on the
instrumental analysis aspects then.
Very best wishes to all
Keith

Friends,
As announced last Friday, we want to open a first round of brainstorming about the
contents of our project. We have collected what we have received from You so far and
have it mixed with our own ideas (file Brainstorming-1.doc). It does not have a nice
structure and there are still a number of question marks, as You will see.
Please add things where you think something is missing and please feel free to tell us
which points make no sense, or are too ambitious or simply too much work.
Please consider also the ""how to do it"" (state of the art methods, new approaches to
solve problems, other data than those mentioned, other topics.....).
Please try also to find Your position in the project, tell us what You would prefer to
do....
Please try to consider whether we would have to include other groups in terms of
scientific potential and/or in terms of data (For example: Keith Briffa you mentioned
Fritz Schweingruber as the leading data holder of Alpine tree-ring data. Do you think we
should ask him to join us, or could You use his data also without him being a contractor
of the project? In case You want him in the project could we kindly ask you to contact
him, being much more familiar with him and with the tree-ring topic than we are?)
We would be glad to receive a very short answer from everybody within this week, because
from June 30th to July 15th all the three of us will not be at the institute.
For more detailed considerations and answers You have more time, it would be nice to be
able to study them after our return by mid of July. But please use also the
possibilities to contact  the other groups - the sooner we integrate to a group the
better it is.
Our time-table for the rest of the time until October:
July 16th to August 14th: We are at the institute, hoping to bring the project into a
near to final version what concerns the scientific content
August 15th to August 28th: Ice core conference at Kangerlussuaq (Greenland)
August 29th to September 17th: We are at the institute most of the time. We hope this
will be the time to elaborate the EU-shaped complete version.
September 18th to September 22nd: Big events going on in Vienna which may cut down our
time for the project (150th anniversary of our institute, Climate conference DACH-2001
(in German))
September 24th to October: Time reserved for all the things that could not be done yet
in spite of our time table
Could each of You please inform us about Your time table during summer and autumn?
A question to all of You: How do You think about one 2-days meeting this Summer or in
early September? What place do You prefer? If it is Austria we would have two low cost
possibilities: 1): at our institute  and 2) (more adventurous): At the
Sonnblick-observatory (You do not have to have Alpinistic experience, we have a private
cable car going up)
Some remaining questions:
Should we try a 2-years or a 3-years project?
Can everybody live with roughly 300.000 Euro (This would result into somewhere between
1.5 and two millions, which we heard is a magnitude preferred by the commission). Please
consider not only the sum of money but also how to spend it and how to fill it with a
reasonable equivalent in work amount.
What is your feeling about the ""Climate variability atlas of the Alps""? Is it good to
have one main deliverable like that or should we better produce a number of smaller
things?
One last technical remark:  Please send your comments and mails not only to Vienna, but
also to the other groups (or at least to those You believe would be interested in what
You write). I do not think this would spoil too much our mail boxes and it has the
advantage to include the whole intellectual power of our group into the construction
phase of the proposal.
Looking forward to Your replies, ideas, time tables and anything else
With best regards
Reinhard

"Dear Tom,
Thanks for forwarding the message from John Christy. Excuse me for being
so blunt, but John's message is just a load of utter garbage.
I got a laugh out of John's claim that Santer et al. (2008) was ""poorly
done"". This was kind of ironic coming from a co-author of the Douglass
et al. (2007) paper, which used a fundamentally flawed statistical test
to compare modeled and observed tropospheric temperature trends. To my
knowledge, John has NEVER acknowledged that Douglass et al. used a
flawed statistical test to reach incorrect conclusions - despite
unequivocal evidence from the ""synthetic data"" experiments in Santer et
al. (2008) that the Douglass et al. ""robust consistency"" test was simply
wrong. Unbelievably, Christy continues to assert that the results of
Douglass et al. (2007) ""still stand"". I can only shake my head in
amazement at such intellectual dishonesty. I guess the best form of
defense is a ""robust"" attack.
So how does John support his contention that Santer et al. (2008) was
""poorly done""? He begins by stating that:
""Santer et al. 2008 used ERSST data which I understand has now been
changed in a way that discredits the conclusion there"".
Maybe you or Tom Peterson or Dick Reynolds can enlighten me on this one.
How exactly have NOAA ERSST surface data changed? Recall that Santer et
al. (2008) actually used two different versions of the ERSST data
(version 2 and version 3). We also used HadISST sea-surface temperature
data, and combined SSTs and land 2m temperature data from HadCRUT3v. In
other words, we used four different observational estimates of surface
temperature changes. Our bottom-line conclusion (no significant
discrepancy between modeled and observed lower-tropospheric lapse-rate
trends) was not sensitive to our choice of observed surface temperature
dataset.
John next assets that:
""Haimberger's v1.2-1.4 (of the radiosonde data) are clearly spurious due
to the error in ECMWF as published many places"".
I'll let Leo Haimberger respond to that one. And if v1.2 of Leo's data
is ""clearly spurious"", why did John Christy agree to be a co-author on
the Douglass et al. paper which uses upper-air data from v1.2?
Santer et al. (2008) comprehensively examined structural uncertainties
in the observed upper-air datasets. They looked at two different
satellite and seven different radiosonde-based estimates of tropospheric
temperature change. As in the case of the surface temperature data,
getting the statistical test right was much more important (in terms of
the bottom-line conclusions) than the choice of observational upper-air
dataset.
Christy's next criticism of our IJoC paper is even more absurd. He
states that:
""Santer et al. 2008 asked a very different question...than we did. Our
question was ""Does the IPCC BEST ESTIMATE agree with the Best Data
(including RSS)?"" Answer - No.  Santer et al. asked, ""Does ANY IPCC
model agree with ANY data set?"" ... I think you can see the difference.
Actually, we asked and answered BOTH of these questions. ""Tests with
individual model realizations"" are described in Section 4.1 of Santer et
al. (2008), while Section 4.2 covers ""Tests with multi-model
ensemble-mean trend"". As should be obvious - even to John Christy - we
did NOT just compare observations with results from individual models.
For both types of test (""individual model"" and ""multi-model average""),
we found that, if one applied appropriate statistical tests (which
Douglass et al. failed to do), there was no longer a serious discrepancy
between modeled and observed trends in tropical lapse rates or in
tropical tropospheric temperatures.
Again, I find myself shaking my head in amazement. How can John make
such patently false claims about our paper? The kindest interpretation
is that he is a complete idiot, and has not even bothered to read Santer
et al. (2008) before making erroneous criticisms of it. The less kind
interpretation is that he is deliberately lying.
A good scientist is willing to acknowledge the errors he or she commits
(such as applying an inappropriate statistical test). John Christy is
not a good scientist. I'm not a religious man, but I'm sure willing to
thank some higher authority that Dr. John Christy is not the
""gatekeeper"" of what constitutes sound science.
I hope you don't mind, Tom, but I'm copying this email to some of the
other co-authors of the Santer et al. (2008) IJoC paper. They deserve to
know about the kind of disinformation Christy is spreading.
With best regards,
Ben

in response to Nadia's message and our talk - consider the following as regards title and
objectives
Title
The precedence of Ecological  Responses to 20th Century Climate changes in Arctic Lakes and
Trees
Suggested Objectives
We will quantify how the changes in 20th century Arctic climate (including mean and
variability) are reflected in recent and past lake sediment records. We will determine the
response of lake ecosystem  parameters and the relationships with specific climatic
controls.
We will define the character of variability in different natural archives contained in
dated sediments reaching back over 2000 years. We will generate well-calibrated ,
high-resolution (decadal to centennial time scales) estimates of past summer climate
variability over this time in western Arctic Siberia.
We will compare the lake sediment data with evidence of tree-growth and associated summer
climate changes , based on selected updating of an extensive, existing network of
chronologies, including long sub-fossil series extending back more than 4000 years in Yamal
and Taimyr. These  data (with perfect inter-annual dating accuracy) will be reprocessed to
provide summer temperatures specifically representative of annual, decadal and centennial
timescales.
We will determine (for the first time) the extent to which the independent proxy-based
summer climate  histories concur or disagree and explore the extent to which they
demonstrate the precedence of  recent (20th century ) climate trends  in a multi-millennial
context. By comparing this evidence with the output of state-of-the-art GCM experiments ,
simulating climate changes in the Arctic over the last 500 to 1000 years, we will explore
the degree to which recent changes in Arctic lakes (and tree-growth rates) are attributable
to anthropogenic as opposed to natural climate changes.

Dear readers,
If the majority of your photos are posed snapshots and
landscapes, a fast camera may not matter. But if you've ever
missed a shot because your camera was busy processing the
previous photo, the Leica Digilux 1 will appeal to you. We liked
it too, and we gave it an Editors' Choice award.
Leica Digilux 1: Legendary charm
The legendary German lens maker takes aim at digital-era
street photographers with the Digilux 1. A combination of

"Pennsylvania voters overwhelmingly oppose Sen. Pat Toomey's obstruction of Chief Judge Merrick Garland's Supreme Court nomination.
Today, the Constitutional Responsibility Project released its first television ad. The 30-second spot
showcases Sen. Toomey's (R-PA) unprecedented refusal to consider any Supreme Court nominee and calls on Sen. Toomey to put the Constitution before his politics. The ad will air in the Philadelphia media market over the Senate recess.
Additionally, the Constitutional Responsibility Project, in conjunction with the League of Conservation Voters, released a new survey of Pennsylvania voters conducted by Hart Research. The survey found that Pennsylvania voters support giving Judge Garland a hearing and an up-or-down vote and strongly disapprove of the positon Senate Republican leadership has taken on this matter.
""This poll shows that Pennsylvanians strongly believe that Senator Toomey and others must give the president's nominee both a fair hearing and a timely vote, and LCV members couldn't agree more.  Nearly 150,000 of them have signed a petition calling on the Senate to do its job, including nearly 5,000 in Pennsylvania alone,"" said Tiernan Sittenfeld, Senior Vice President of Government Affairs, League of Conservation Voters.
A full memo from Hart Research Associates outlining the survey's findings and polling method can be found HERE
.
Key findings from the Constitutional Responsibility Project and the League of Conservation Voters survey include:
*   By a margin of 56 percent to 37 percent, Pennsylvania voters say the Senate should hold hearings and give Chief Judge Garland an up-or-down-vote.
*   Independent voters agree with this position by an event larger margin - 60 percent to 36 percent.
*   After voters hear the pros and cons on Senator Toomey's positon on the Supreme Court vacancy, feelings toward him become notably less favorable.
*   Independents move from a small net positive view of Toomey (24 percent positive, 18 percent negative) to a large net negative opinion of him (24 percent positive, 50 percent negative).
*   At the start of the survey, 43 percent of voters said they were inclined to vote for Senator Toomey over his Democratic challenger. After being told about his stance on Judge Garland's nomination, 46 percent of voters said they are less likely to support Senator Toomey.
*   16 percent of voters said they would be more open to voting for the Democratic challenger as a result of Senator Toomey's opposition to hearings and a vote for Judge Garland.
Wisconsin voters do not approve of Sen. Johnson's Supreme Court obstruction.
Roll Call
reports on a new poll finding that Sen. Ron Johnson's (R-WI) continued refusal to consider Chief Judge Garland's nomination runs counter to the values of Wisconsin voters.
""60 percent of likely Wisconsin voters want to see the president and Senate take action to fill the vacancy now... Roughly half of voters felt that by blocking Obama's nominee, senators were ""trying to advance their party's agenda rather than doing what is right for the country.""
After meeting with Chief Merrick Garland yesterday, Sen. Gary Peters lauds his ""impeccable legal credentials.
The Detroit News
reports:
Sen. Peters (D-MI): ""He comes to this nomination with ... impeccable legal credentials. On top of that, he has the benefit of already being confirmed for his current position with broad bipartisan support. So this is the type of candidate that certainly deserves to have a hearing.""""
Chief Judge Garland is exactly the type of jurist we want on the Court.
Former U.S. solicitor general Ted Olson writes in the Wall Street Journal
:
Ted Olson, former U.S. solicitor general: ""Mr. Garland is extraordinarily well qualified...Throughout his career, he has impressed his colleagues and his legal adversaries with his leadership, sense of fairness, and respect for the law. He has been a judge for 19 years and is now chief judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, considered by many to be the second-most-important court in the country. Scalia and three current justices also served on the D.C. circuit. By temperament, character and qualifications, Judge Garland is precisely the kind of jurist we want on the Supreme Court.  For Republicans, there is much to recommend giving Mr. Garland a good look, a respectful hearing and a vote on the merits.""
Chief Judge Garland will approach the legal issues that face the disability community with thought and care.
Michael Waterston, an expert in disability and civil rights law, reviewed Chief Judge Garland's record and found him to be a thoughtful and fair jurist.
Michael Waterstone, disability and civil rights law expert: ""How will Justice Garland rule on the important issues facing the disability community - things like whether websites need to be accessible to individuals who are blind, or how far employers need to go in providing accommodations to workers with disabilities, or whether voters with disabilities are entitled to secret and independent ballots, like everyone else? I don't know...But I do feel confident that Justice Garland would approach the questions carefully and thoughtfully, and without a predefined agenda against the rights of people with disabilities.""[Loyola Law School, 4/28/16

"Dear friends of the Imprint - SSC,
After seeing the evaluation summary of our
proposal, and not least the same for Millennium,
it is clear to me that we have been very badly
treated, first by the public advice from the
Commission in Utrecht who advised the community
to create a proposal which we did, but which is
orthogonal to what they now have decided to
negotiate, later by the random way we were
reviewed and the many inconsistencies in the
evaluation. Compared to this the Millennium
review was full of subjective phrases and a
number of negative aspects were glossed over.
The review is an insult, and it appears likely
that elements in the panel bear some grudges
against our community. In order to get the 0.5
point difference between Imprint and Millennium
they had to give a number of very imbalanced
statements. They also had to raise the management
score of Millennium to 4 by the xtended panel
despite critisisms by the reviewers  that the
management was not well laid out.
I feel that the review was very biased and the
result is that they will probably fund a project
with only limited relevance to the call, and miss
a major opportunity of integrating European
paleoclimate research and climate modelling and
create a new major step forward.
We have been advised to send a formal letter of
complaint to the Commission, asking for a renewed
evaluation, not because we think there is a good
chance that it will lead to much, but we think it
is important that they know that they have upset
a community consisting of top level European
scientists, This may help us in the longer term.
The advice I have got is to send this to Pierre
Valette, co-signed by the key partners, both
their PIs and head of administration, with copies
to our individual national members of the Global
Change Panel of the EU.
So far there is no formal decision on which
proposal to fund, this may happen in September
after negotiations with the selected proposals.
There is a seldom precedence in Europe that such
an intervention has been successful, but very
rarely.
In phrasing such a letter we have to be very
careful and make sure our message is clear and
fair, but I think it needs to be done.
I would therefore ask you to respond immediately
to this mail as to whether you think we should go
this route or not. We will then in a few days
send out a draft for comments, if you agree that
we shall send in a complaint. We have to move
fast here, so I hope you will be quick.
Concerning the other proposals on what to do,
there are many good ideas, and I think we should
have a meeting in the autumn to discuss the
strategy of securing paleo in the 7th Framwork
program. The text is out for review now, and we
all need to suggest changes through our national
representatives. I will distribute a list of who
this is for the various countries over the
week-end.
I am also working on formulating  text to help
launch our ideas in teh European Parliament via
Atte´s wife.

XXVI General Assembly, Spring EGS Meeting
Comparison of Large-Scale Proxy-Based Temperature Reconstructions Over the
Past Few Centuries
MANN, M.E.; RUTHERFORD, S; OSBORN, T.J.
OA28.0  Study of past climates: Climate of the past millennium
JOUZEL, J.; (co-conveners: JONES, P.D.; MANN, M.E.)
Comparison of Large-Scale Proxy-Based Temperature Reconstructions Over the
Past Few Centuries
M.E. Mann(1), S. Rutherford(1), and T.J. Osborn(2)
(1) Univ. of Virginia, USA, (2) Climate Research Unit, Univ. East Anglia, UK
A  promising approach to the problem of reconstructing patterns of past
climate variability
involves the application of spatial climate field reconstruction (CFR)
techniques to networks of proxy
climate indicators (e.g., Mann et al 1998;2000--see

This approach seeks to exploit the complimentary information in a diverse
network of proxy indicators by determining the most consistent
relationships between these
networks of data and  the leading spatial patterns of climate variability
during a recent ""calibration"" period of overlap with the modern
instrumental record.
The calibrated relationship is then used to estimate large-scale patterns
of climate variability
in the past from the proxy data. This method makes no  assumptions regarding
the relationship between a given proxy indicator and specific local
annual/seasonal climate variable, but
does assume that the proxy indicator is tied to some combination of
large-scale patterns of climate variability.
Alternatively,  it is possible to  estimate large-scale temperature
patterns from a relatively homogenous network
of proxy climate indicators (e.g., tree-ring density data--see Briffa et
al, 1998) by invoking
a local calibration between each climate indicator and the climate variable
(e.g., summer temperature)
of interest. This approach is more conservative in the amount of
information it seeks to
extract from the proxy data network, but it is free from assumptions
regarding the large-scale
patterns of past climate variability. Recent reconstructions of Northern
Hemisphere annual-mean and
warm-season temperature patterns using these respective approaches and data
show some similarities,
but also some important differences. Here we investigate these differences
more closely, examining
the sensitivity of Northern Hemisphere temperature pattern reconstructions
to (a) the underlying
proxy data used, (b) the particular method used to estimate large-scale
patterns from these data,
and (c) the target  seasonality of the reconstruction. By controlling
independently for each of these
three factors, we gain insight into the reasons for differences between
various proxy-based estimates
of past large-scale temperature variability.

"NSM News Release:
German Government Hate's Free Speech, persecutes White Musicians & Activists:
I was just informed that one of the new German bands on the NSM Record Label had 4 of their recorded songs for their upcoming cd release on NSM Records, and their instruments seized by the German Government. The name of the band is Gojm, or Goyim in English (Goyim is a jewish word for Gentiles meaning Human Cattle).
What the German Zog does not know is that the 4 tracks they seized were the bonus tracks for the album, the other 8 songs, 39 minutes of music was already recorded and has already left Germany to be released here by NSM Records in the United States. The band has not been arrested, but as they put it, their songs and instruments were arrested.
We will release the forbidden/verboten cd with the 8 tracks that made it out of Germany, and if the other tracks are ever returned we may make them available on-line as free mp3's, or use them on a future release.
Here in the U.S. we still have the right to Freedom of speech, and musical freedom to play whatever kind of music we want. In Nations like Germany, a cd, questioning the Holohoax, a song, a Politically incorrect newspaper, or even a Salute can get you thrown in jail.
The German Government crackdown on musicians/bands such as musical greats like Landser, and countless other National Socialists activists, including the thousands of Political Prisoners in German jails rotting away for speaking words of truth and Patriotism, should light a fire under all of us to do even more in the Worldwide struggle for National Socialism.
I will end this NSM News Release with a message to the German Government: Your Tyranny against your own Citizens has not gone unnoticed by the International Community, nor the thousands of our Comrades you jail for thought and speech crimes. You are breeding a Revolution, a Revolution that is just about ready to snap and breakout into your streets, especially in the East. We National Socialists here in the U.S., and our International Allies will continue to do our part to support those you persecute.

Malcolm,
Thanks for that, much appreciated.
I'll forward it on to Gil Compo and others linked to ACRE and
the AOPC WGs.  I think that Roger Stone from Queensland knows some of
your people, so there should be some good links all round.
I've also gone back to Howard Diamond, the US GCOS Rep, from
whom I'm hoping to get some financial support for such a meeting to
gauge his reaction to holding it in Europe.
Cheers,  Rob.

Former critic plans 'Lobbyists for Trump' fundraiser
Washington Examiner - Gabby Morrongiello
A top Washington lobbyist who previously called Donald Trump ""a joke,"" now plans to host a fundraiser for the Republican presidential front-runner in early June.
Jack Burkman of J.M. Burkman and Associates will host government relations professionals and other lobbyists in the D.C. suburb of Arlington, Va. on June 10 as part of his ""Lobbyists for Trump"" effort.
According to an advisory released Monday, Burkman intends to raise $200 million over the next six months for the leading GOP candidate to use should he make it to the general election.
Burkman's effort to fundraise for the New York billionaire comes seven months after the D.C. lobbyist took out a full-page ad in the Los Angeles Daily News criticizing Trump and the other Republican presidential hopefuls at the time for not taking a firm stance against same-sex marriage.
""Donald Trump: You have no moral compass. You've been pro-choice, pro-life, pro-choice and now pro-life again,"" Burkman wrote in the ad.
He added, ""You'd believe anything that would get you elected. You're a joke.""

Cambodia temple ruins yield treasure
Workers clearing dense jungle near the ruins of an ancient pagoda in
northern Cambodia have unearthed 31 Buddha statues - 27 of them solid gold.
The statues - which are 10 centimetres (4 inches) tall - are in good
condition and believed to be hundreds of years old.
They were found on Saturday as workers were rebuilding the Po Pich temple
about 100 km (65miles) north of the capital, Phnom Penh.
The pagoda, in the Batay district of Kampong Thom province, was torn down
during the reign of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s and the area became
overgrown.
Community care
Deputy police chief of Kampong Thom province, Hang Sithim, said the statues
- three of which were silver and one bronze - were buried in about one metre
(3.4ft) of earth and each weigh around 500 grams (1lb).
''I think that these Buddha statues had been buried hundreds of years ago,
when the last temple was fully operating,"" Mr Hang Sithim said.
Provincial authorities initially planned to take the statues to a nearby
town for safekeeping, but opted to allow the Buddhist community at the
temple to take care of them.
''We believe they are safe there,'' said Som Somphat, deputy governor of
Kampong Thom province.
''The people of Po Pich pledged to treat them with respect and honour.''
Reign of terror
A police guard has been placed around the site to protect it from looters.
The Khmer Rouge waged civil war in Cambodia between 1970 and 1998 and
controlled the country between 1975 and 1979.
The regime outlawed religion and destroyed many objects regarded as decadent
or culturally impure.
About two million people died in the Khmer Rouge's drive to turn Cambodia
into a farmers' utopia.

"Trump aides huddle with RNC to plot big-money strategy
The presumptive nominee seeks to exert control over the Republican Party.
By KENNETH P. VOGEL, ELI STOKOLS and ALEX ISENSTADT
05/09/16 05:26 PM EDT
Updated 05/09/16 06:17 PM EDT
Donald Trump's campaign is hashing out the details of an agreement with Republican Party leaders that could allow the presumptive GOP presidential nominee to raise six-figure checks for his presidential campaign, multiple sources with direct knowledge of the negotiations tell POLITICO.
The fundraising agreement was among the subjects discussed at a Monday meeting at the Republican National Committee's Washington offices between top RNC officials, including chairman Reince Priebus, and senior Trump aides, including campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, senior adviser Paul Manafort and political director Rick Wiley, according to the sources.
The talks represent the first formal steps towards a merger between the official apparatus of the Republican Party and a candidate who many party leaders scorned until recently, and about whom there remains deep leeriness in some Republican quarters.
Since Trump essentially clinched the GOP nomination with a win in last week's Indiana primary, his staff have moved quickly to put their stamp on the party's general election planning process. Wiley has paid several visits to the party's headquarters on Capitol Hill to assess its efforts, according to the sources. The campaign also has been discussing convention-related issues with the RNC, including credentials and rules, the sources said, adding that the campaign is expected in the coming days to formally deputize a staffer as a liaison to the national party committee.
And deputy campaign manager Michael Glassner this week is set to lead a delegation to the convention site, Cleveland's Quicken Loans Arena, to receive a briefing from RNC officials involved in planning for the July event, as POLITICO first reported
last week.
Fundraising was not a major focus of Monday's meetings, according to RNC senior strategist Sean Spicer. ""It was 3 ½ hours on briefings from all the RNC divisions regarding the capabilities and resources that we have been compiling to win in November,"" said Spicer, who attended the meeting, and said it included presentations on the party's ground game, and its data, communications and research efforts.
The conversations are also partly an effort to lay the groundwork for a Thursday meeting in Washington between Trump, Priebus and House Speaker Paul Ryan, who announced last Thursday that he is withholding his endorsement until Trump outlines a stronger commitment to conservative principles.
The perception among Trump's inner circle is that Ryan is attempting to leverage his position as chairman of the Cleveland convention into securing a deal that protects the party's control over vendor contracts and how the money raised jointly by the party and Trump's campaign is spent.
""Trump is a tough negotiator, understands the history of what he's entitled to here,"" another Trump confidant said. ""They want the RNC to be autonomous but they'll work with the Trump campaign. They need Trump to help raise the money but they want their vendors to be the ones to spend the money.""
But Trump may be more reliant on the national party than past presidential nominees, since his campaign has invested relatively little in field staff, voter data or a fundraising operation.
Some of Trump's infrastructure deficiencies can be traced to his unwillingness to dig deep into his own fortune to finance his campaign, which he has pledged from the beginning to self-finance.
Entering into a joint fundraising agreement and leaning on the party for cash and staff would help fill that void in an election expected to cost each side more than $1 billion. But it also could undermine his rhetoric about being independent from the party's donor class.
Trump has already agreed to appear next week at a $25,000 per-plate fundraiser to benefit the New Jersey Republican Party, just days after the New York billionaire tapped Gov. Chris Christie to run his presidential transition.
The May 19 event is being billed as a ""roundtable"" with Christie and Trump, and will be held at the Lawrenceville National Guard Armory, according to an invitation obtained by POLITICO. Just 12 people will be permitted to attend the roundtable, according to a note sent with the invitation.
The RNC has been taking the lead in reaching out to state parties to put together the joint fundraising arrangement with Trump's campaign, and its plans are actually further along than they were at this point four years ago, said one source familiar with the negotiations.
""I know (the Trump campaign staff) have been impressed with what the RNC already has on the ground,"" said the source. ""Four years ago, when Romney walked into the building, the RNC didn't have anywhere close to the field staff that it has now. ... There is a big difference.""
Yet efforts to finalize the agreement also could test the willingness of state GOP officials to get behind a presumptive nominee who some official openly opposed during the contentious primary.
Colorado's state party appeared to gloat last month after Trump's vanquished rival Ted Cruz swept all 34 delegate slots at the state's caucus. ""We did it. #NeverTrump,"" the state party tweeted, only to delete and disavow
the post minutes later.
Party spokesman Kyle Kohli on Monday said the Colorado GOP hasn't had any talks with Trump or the RNC about a joint fundraising agreement.
The South Carolina Republican Party is open to participating but hasn't engaged in any talks yet, said the chairman, Matt Moore.
The more state parties that participate, the more money a Trump joint fundraising committee can accept, thanks in part to a 2014 Supreme Court case called McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission
. It struck down aggregate limits on total giving to federal campaigns, allowing maximum donations to as many different committees as a donor wanted.
Trump's likely general election opponent, Hillary Clinton, created an unprecedented joint fundraising committee
with the Democratic National Committee and 32 state party committees that can accept checks as large as $356,100 this year.
Early in the election cycle, the talk among GOP state party officials was of a joint fundraising committee that could include all 50 states and six territories, allowing maximum donations of about $1 million per person, according to one state party chairman. But those talks quieted as Trump's surprising rise threw the GOP primary into chaos, said the chairman.
Sources with knowledge of the RNC's current plans said its joint fundraising arrangement would include between four and 12 state committees, which could allow the committee to accept checks ranging from $78,800 and $158,000.
The joint committee could help Trump's campaign as well as the RNC, which has struggled to keep its finances intact. The committee ended March with just $16 million on hand and nearly $2 million in outstanding debt. Taken together, the bank account is a fraction of where the committee had been at similar points in 2008 and 2012.
Many Republican state party chairs, who depend on the RNC to fund a get-out-the-vote program, are anxious to see Trump and the committee form an agreement.
""We are a battleground state and we can expect a lot of money to support our push,"" said Rob Gleason, the Pennsylvania GOP chair. ""We already were getting a lot of money from the RNC, but we need a lot more.""
""Trump should be able to get us up to speed,"" he added.",False,"This email appears to be a news article discussing the details of Donald Trump's campaign strategy and fundraising efforts within the Republican Party. It provides specific details and quotes from various sources, indicating that it is not a phishing attempt but rather a legitimate news report."

Mike, Ray, Caspar,
A couple of things - don't pass on either.
1. Have seen you're RC bet. Not entirely sure this is the right way to go,
but it will drum up some discussion.
Anyway Mike and Caspar have seen me present possible problems with the
SST data (in the 1940s/50s and since about 2000). The first of these will appear
in Nature on May 29. There should be a News and Views item with this article
by Dick Reynolds. The paper concludes by pointing out that SSTs now (or since
about 2000, when the effect gets larger) are likely too low. This likely won't
get corrected quickly as it really needs more overlap to increase confidence.
Bottom line for me is that it appears SSTs now are about 0.1 deg C too cool
globally. Issue is that the preponderance of drifters now (which measure SST
better but between 0.1 and 0.2 lower than ships) mean anomalies are low
relative to the ship-based 1961-90 base.
This also means that the SST base the German modellers used in their runs
was likely too warm by a similar amount. This applies to all modellers, reanalyses etc.
There will be a lot of discussion of the global T series with people saying we can't
even measure it properly now.
The 1940s/50s problem with SSTs (the May 29 paper) also means there will be
warmer SSTs for about 10 years. This will move the post-40s cooling to a little
later - more in line with higher sulphate aerosol loading in the late 50s and 1960s70s.
The paper doesn't provide a correction. This will come, but will include the addition
of loads more British SSTs for WW2, which may very slightly cool the WW2 years.
More British SST data have also been digitized for the late 1940s. Budget
constraints mean that only about half the RN log books have been digitized. Emphasis
has been given to the South Atlantic and Indian Ocean log books.
As an aside, it is unfortunate that there are few in the Pacific. They have digitized
all the logbooks of the ships journeys from the Indian Ocean south of Australia and NZ
to Seattle for refits. Nice bit of history here - it turns out that most of the ships
are
US ones the UK got under the Churchill/Roosevelt deal in early 1940. All the RN bases
in South Africa, India and Australia didn't have parts for these ships for a few years.
So the German group would be stupid to take your bet.  There is a likely
ongoing negative volcanic event in the offing!
2. You can delete this attachment if you want. Keep this quiet also, but
this is the person who is putting in FOI requests for all emails Keith and Tim
have written and received re Ch 6 of AR4. We think we've found a way
around this.
I can't wait for the Wengen review to come out with the Appendix showing what
that 1990 IPCC Figure was really based on.
The Garnaut review appears to be an Australian version of the Stern Report.
This message will self destruct in 10 seconds!

Subject: ICYMI: Donald Trump and the Art of the Tax Loophole
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Donald Trump and the Art of the Tax Loophole
The New York Times
By Steven Rattner
May 13, 2016

​-​
stops/donald-trump-and-the-art-of-the-tax-loophole.html
TYPE “Trump system rigged” into the Google search bar and you’ll get more than 500,000 hits. I didn’t inspect all of them but the first 50 were variants of Donald Trump complaining that the Republican primary process was tilted against him.
That’s beyond ironic. Mr. Trump and his family have been the beneficiaries of a great rigged system: the tax code, which bestows huge advantages on the real estate business. Throughout his career, Mr. Trump has not only grabbed for every loophole and legal lever he could find, he’s boasted about it.
“I’ve taken advantage of the laws of this country, like other people,” Mr. Trump has said.
The Republican front-runner has been dodging releasing his returns on the specious grounds that he was being audited. On Tuesday, he told The Associated Press that he wouldn’t release them before the election — period. On Wednesday, he denied saying this, reversed course and said,“Hopefully before the election I’ll release.”
“There’s nothing to learn from them,” he said in the Associated Press interview.
I’ll bet there’s plenty to learn. More likely, Mr. Trump doesn’t want us to know how small his tax hit is, something that he bragged about earlier in the campaign, before realizing that it could come back to bite him.
“I fight like hell to pay as little as possible,” Mr. Trump said last August.
Real estate guys can take advantage of the best loopholes left in the tax code, thanks in part to some aggressive nudging of lawmakers. For starters, real estate investors can take deductions for the ostensible depreciation of the value of their buildings, even though the point of owning buildings is that they generally appreciate.
For another, they often borrow against those properties, and because they hold these investments in partnerships or limited liability companies, the interest payments are tax-deductible.
“If you get close to paying taxes, you just buy another building,” a real estate friend told me.
If Mr. Trump were to sell a property, the profits would be taxed as capital gains at far lower rates (23.8 percent) than those imposed on ordinary income (39.6 percent). But real estate owners often don’t even pay capital gains taxes. They can take advantage of a provision known as Section 1031 to swap a piece of real estate that they are ready to part with for one that they would like to add to their portfolio — all tax free. There is no limit on how many swaps they can make, deferring capital gains taxes indefinitely.
Section 1031 is among the real estate operators’ favorite provisions — and it’s a break not readily available to other kinds of investors. No wonder that attempts to rein in or eliminate Section 1031, including a recent one by the Obama administration, have been met with fierce resistance from the industry.
The tax benefits don’t stop, even at death. If an investor dies holding appreciated properties, the heirs get a step up in basis, which means that they can sell the real estate and pay no taxes on the gain in value.
Mr. Trump’s quest for loopholes ranges far. In 2005, he got a $39.1 million tax deduction for donating a conservation easement on a New Jersey golf course, meaning that any further development on the property is restricted. On top of that, he installed goats on two of his New Jersey golf courses as part of a plan to get them designated as agricultural properties, thereby vastly lowering his property taxes.
Meanwhile, according to Mr. Trump’s campaign, from 2010 to 2014, he “donated” more than $102 million to charity — without giving away even $1 of his own money. More conservation easements constituted the biggest source of deductions, but the “gifts” included items like free rounds of golf for charity events. Many of these “charitable contributions,” of course, gave rise to more tax deductions.
Taxes are far from the only way that Mr. Trump has gamed the system. He’s added materially to his net worth by pushing the edges of the bankruptcy laws.
By arguing that his name had huge commercial value, for example, he managed to retain more ownership in his Atlantic City hotel and casino projects than is customary in an insolvency, thereby minimizing his losses while his creditors lost billions.
Finally, by his own admission, Mr. Trump has used our broken campaign finance system to achieve private gain by giving generously to politicians of both parties (including to Hillary Clinton) in order to gain influence. Since 1989, he has donated more than $1.5 million to political causes, 62 percent of it going to Republicans, according to PolitiFact.
“When they call, I give,” Mr. Trump said in the first Republican debate. “And you know what? When I need something from them, two years later, three years later, I call them. They are there for me.”
Among the ways that politicians have been there for him and his brethren has been developing a tax system in which real estate moguls pay little or no taxes. “The Declaration of Independence tells us that all men are created equal, but the government definitely favors real estate investors!” wrote one such investor, David Lindahl. Where did this appear? “Trump University Commercial Real Estate Investing 101.”

"Talking about Ted Cruz, and about how to make GOP convention more exciting
Please Save from yesterday: 
Donald Trump called on Ted Cruz on Monday to quit the presidential race and go back to the U.S. Senate if Tuesday's Indiana primary ends with the billlionaire beating the senator.
'Yes, he should. He should leave the race if I win,' Trump told DailyMail.com in a wide-ranging interview at an Indianapolis hotel during his last day of campaigning in the Hoosier State.
'Now, let's see what happens. Indiana's a great state and I have the support of Bobby Knight and so many other people. We'll have to see what happens, but yes, I think he should get out of the race,' Trump said.
The Republican front-runner also said Cruz's 'tough temperament' might make him unsuitable for a spot on his short-list of potential Supreme Court nominees – a consolation prize he could offer the Texas as a party-unifying gesture.
Instead, Trump insisted Ted prepare to pack his bags – and doubled down on his demand later during a lunchtime stop at Shapiro's Delicatessen a few blocks from Lucas Oil Stadium.
Asked during an impromptu press gaggle whether an Indiana defeat should spell the end of a Cruz candidacy, he told reporters: 'I think it should.'
A Cruz spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Monday morning's interview touched on Trump's foreign policy goals, his attitude toward the media, his criticism of past Republican National Conventions, and whether a President Trump would deliver a comedy routine at the White House Correspondents Association's annual gala.
Indiana's 57 delegates to the Republican National Convention, should Trump claim them in Tuesday's winner-take-all primary election, would put the businessman within striking distance of the magic number – 1,237 – that he needs in order to become the party's White House nominee.
Cruz has insisted that he will stay in the contest all the way to the July convention in Cleveland, Ohio.
he launched an ad Monday in Indiana in which he tries to turn Trump's nickname for him – 'Lyin' Ted' – back on the real estate tycoon.
The ad, titled 'Lying,' features an announcer claiming that 'Donald Trump is lying about Ted Cruz' with respect to the senator's positions on trade, illegal immigration and work visas.
'Trump also had a one-million-dollar judgment against him for hiring illegals,' the ad claims.
'What a phony.'
But Indianans seem to be siding with Trump, giving him a 15-point edge in an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released yesterday.
Trump lashed out at Cruz Monday morning, telling DailyMail.com that he disagrees with the Texan's characterization of him earlier in the day as a hateful bully and his base as 'bitter, angry, petty, bigoted people.'
'That is not America. I reject that vision of America,' Cruz told reporters in Indiana after a campaign stop.
'They're not angry,' Trump said of his loyal following. 'They're very disappointed in politicians like him that get a lot of money from special interest groups, and they protect their special interest groups very much to the detriment of the country.'
Trump has faced calls for specifics about how he will 'unify' the Republican Party if he performs well enough in the remaining ten primary elections to claim the GOP's nomination outright.
But the billionaire said he isn't ready to put Cruz on the Supreme Court as a consolation prize – because his 'temperament' might not be suited to the job.
Cruz, once the solicitor general for the Lone Star State, argued nine cases before America's highest court, winning five of them.
'I don't know. I'd have to think about it. That's a big decision,' he told DailyMail.com, saying that he's aware of Cruz's record as a constitutional lawyer.
'But there's a whole question of uniting, and there's a whole question as to temperament. And I'd have to think about it.'
Trump raised Cruz's 'temperament' four separate times while explaining why putting the lawmaker on his Supreme Court short-list wasn't an easy call.
He has said in the past that in order to quell conservatives' concerns about how he would approach Supreme Court appointments, he would release a list of names during the campaign and pledge to to only choose nominees from it.
'He's got a tough temperament for what we're talking about,' Trump said of Cruz. 'You have to be a very, very smart, rational person in my opinion, to be a justice of any kind at a high level or low.'
'You need a proper temperament. And that would be a question that I would have.'
At Shapiro's, Trump projected confidence as the lunch crowd milled around him and asked for autographs and selfies. He signed one man's $50 bill before dining at a table that included campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and nonfiction author Ed Klein.
Asked whether the general election season begins for him on Wednesday, he said: 'Yes, I mean it's sort of already started.'
Citing a new national poll, he added: 'Rasmussen just came out and I'm three points up on Hillary ... and I haven't even started yet.'",False,"This email appears to be a news article or political commentary discussing the Republican presidential race, particularly focusing on Donald Trump and Ted Cruz.

"I need everyone to send on this time!
TeenScreen is really on the run. If we get our message
to enough people right now, we'll win this game.
TeenScreen will completely disappear and the youth of
America can grow up safely without TeenScreen's
intervention and drugs.
In the last week, there was an article on raising
money for suicide programs in the Vallejo (California)
Times-Herald. Then on Friday they published a letter
to the editor from TeenScreen's director, full of
lies, and with the total intention to gain support for
their suppressive cause.
We need to overwhelm this paper with true data.
Do you know why TeenScreen has been able to get so
far? Because there is a vacuum of information on
suicide. If TeenScreen is the only one popping up and
saying 'here's a solution', they'll win.
The assignment:
1. Read Leslie MacGuire's letter at this link or the
text at the bottom of this message:

2. Rip her to shreds.
Write a letter to the editor and send it to
opinion@timesheraldonline.com
You can write what you want but I have a suggestion.
-If your last name begins with A-C, L-M, or S-Z, I
want you to state that you are writing in response to
MacGuire's letter. You can say almost anything and you
don't have to be nice. I suggest that you point out
that her letter is just advertising, not public
opinion, that suicide screening has never been shown
to reduce suicide, that TeenScreen just leads to more
drugging with drugs known to cause suicide, and that
the use of TeenScreen takes money and effort away from
programs that actually are proven to work! - like
volunteer suicide hotlines, improving education, drug
abuse prevention programs, religious programs. Hell,
you can throw in ""Set a Good Example"" contest and ""The
Way to Happiness"" if you feel like. It will make them
look it up.
-If your last name begins with the other letters, I
suggest that you ignore Leslie and write a letter to
the editor in response to the original article. I
can't deliver you a copy of that article because it's
fee-based. I'm sure it says something about raising
money to prevent suicide and that's all you really
need to know. Your letter mention things like the fact
that mental health screening is bad and just leads to
more psych drug use, that our leaders should find the
true and workable solutions and not just accept any
program that is offered. Also you could bring out the
fact that
suicide is VERY rare, not an epidemic, that there are
other more serious problems like illiteracy and drug
abuse.
3. And report compliance by email.
Thank you!
Doyle
______________________________
LETTER TEXT:
A critical issue
Thank you for your article regarding the recent walk
to raise money for suicide prevention programs
(""Shining a light in the darkness of suicide,"" May
22). Coverage on this important topic helps to shed
light on the critical issue of suicide, a very real
and prevalent problem that is too often overlooked.
In California, suicide is the third leading cause of
death for 15- to
19-year-olds. Studies by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) show that 17 percent of
American high school students think seriously about
suicide and 9 percent have made a suicide attempt.
Research tells us that 90 percent of youth who die by
suicide suffer from a diagnosable and treatable mental
illness at the time of their death, but the vast
majority of these teens are not known to their
parents, teachers or other adults as suffering from a
mental disorder.
In response to this public health crisis, Columbia
University has spent more than a decade developing,
implementing, and evaluating its TeenScreen Program.
TeenScreen is a voluntary mental health screening
program that provides communities throughout the
nation with free tools and training to identify youth
who are at risk for suicide and those suffering from
unidentified mental illness. Screening is always
voluntary and no child is screened without a parent's
permission.
Mental illness and suicide are public health issues
which should be public concerns. I applaud your
community for taking interest in this critical issue,
and strongly encourage parents, health professionals,
educators and others in your community to prioritize
early intervention and prevention initiatives
including mental health screening to help prevent
unnecessary suffering and the tragedy of suicide.
Leslie McGuire, Director, Columbia University
TeenScreen Program

List of accomplishments for Rob Benson
1. Made a fast and profitable transition from cash cinergy trader to term PJM trader.
2. Current P/L is over $67,000,000, budget for the year was set at $15,000,000.
3. No losing months, worst month was positive $2,700,000.
4. Very high return on VAR, don't have actual numbers ( sorry ).
5. Done two customer load following deals, both have turned out to be very profitable.
6. Exceeded all EOL goals, both number of trades and volume. Each month I'm in the top 3 in east power for number of trades and volume.
7. Have always stayed within my VAR limits
8. I have become the market for all PJM trades, both on and off peak.
9. My P/L has come from intra-day trading as well as an underlying fundamental position in both on and off peak. P/L did not come from just one big move.
10. Have always put on positions based on my fundamental view, even if that view differed from others on the desk.

"Dear folks,
You may be interesting in this snippet of information about
Pat Michaels. Perhaps the University of Wisconsin ought to
open up a public comment period to decide whether Pat Michaels,
PhD needs re-assessing?
Michaels' PhD was, I believe, supervised by Reid Bryson. It dealt
with statistical (regression-based) modeling of crop-climate
relationships. In his thesis, Michaels claims that his statistical
model showed that weather/climate  variations could explain 95%
of the inter-annual variability in crop yields. Had this been
correct, it would have been a remarkable results. Certainly, it
was at odds with all previous studies of crop-climate relationships,
which generally showed that weather/climate could only explain about
50% of inter-annual yield variability.
How did result come about? The answer is simple. In Michaels'
regressions he included a trend term. This was at the time a common
way to account for the effects of changing technology on yield. It
turns out that the trend term accounts for 90% of the variability,
so that, in Michaels' regressions, weather/climate explains just 5
of the remaining 10%. In other words, Michaels' claim that
weather/climate explains 95% of the variability is completely
bogus.
Apparently, none of Michaels' thesis examiners noticed this. We
are left with wondering whether this was deliberate misrepresentation
by Michaels, or whether it was simply ignorance.
As an historical note, I discovered this many years ago when working
with Dick Warrick and Tu Qipu on crop-climate modeling. We used a
spatial regression method, which we developed for the wheat belt of
southwestern Western Australia. We carried out similar analyses for
winter wheat in the USA, but never published the results.
Wigley, T.M.L. and Tu Qipu, 1983:  Crop-climate modelling using spatial
patterns of yield and climate:  Part 1, Background and an example from
Australia. Journal of Climate and Applied Meteorology 22, 1831–1841.
There never was a ""Part 2"".

"Obamacare brings record low for US health uninsured rate
CNBC
How low can Obamacare go?
Fewer than 1 in 10 Americans lacked health insurance in 2015, the first time ever in the nation's history that the uninsured rate has fallen so low, and a clear sign of Obamacare's impact.
The U.S. uninsurance rate fell to 9.1 percent last year, according to data released Tuesday by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
It was the first time the percentage of people without some form of health coverage has gone into single digits, and a 2.4 percentage point drop from 2014.
The number of people uninsured in 2015 was 28.6 million, which was 7.4 million fewer than 2014, according to the CDC.
Since 2011, when the uninsured rate stood at 15.1 percent, that rate has fallen 6 full percentage points, according to the CDC's National Health Interview Survey.
Obamacare began going into full effect in 2014, which was the first year that people could have private health insurance plans purchased on government-run marketplaces. That was also the first year that nearly all Americans were obligated to have some form of health insurance or face a possible tax penalty.
Before that, the Affordable Care Act had for the first time allowed adults under the age of 26 to stay on their parents' health plans, which was another factor that has played a role in driving down the uninsured rate.
A third factor in bringing down the uninsured rate has been the expansion of Medicaid benefits in a majority of states to cover many more poor adults than had been eligible under that joint federal-state health insurance program before the ACA became law.
The Obama administration has said more than 20 million Americans have gained health insurance coverage since the ACA became law in 2010.
The new report Tuesday was warmly greeted by the Obama administration, which last week lost a key court decision that, if upheld, could damage the Obamacare program.
A federal court judge ruled that the administration violated the law by giving insurers money, without congressional approval, to offset the cost of covering subsidized out-of-pocket health costs of many Obamacare customers.
The administration also has been dealing with a flurry of news stories detailing possibly steeper Obamacare rate hikes for 2017, and the departure of some insurers from various markets across the nation.
Sylvia Burwell, secretary of health and human services, said, ""Today's report is further proof that our country has made undeniable and historic strides thanks to the Affordable Care Act.""
""The report documents the progress we've made expanding coverage across the country,"" Burwell said.
""Meanwhile, premiums for employer coverage, Medicare spending and health-care prices have risen at exceptionally slow rates. Our country ought to be proud of how far we've come and where we're going,"" she said.
The CDC's survey found that among adults aged 18-64, the percentage who were uninsured decreased from 16.3 percent in 2014 to 12.8 percent last year.
""A corresponding increase was seen in the percentage having private coverage, from 67.3 percent to 69.7 percent, respectively,"" the report said.
""Among children aged 0-17 years, the percentage who were uninsured decreased from 5.5 percent in 2014 to 4.5 percent in 2015,"" the report said.
""Among those under age 65, the percentage with private coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace [the federal Obamacare exchange HealthCare.gov] or state-based exchanges increased from 2.5 percent (6.7 million) in the fourth quarter of 2014 to 3.4 percent (9.1 million) in the fourth quarter of 2015,"" according to the CDC.
The report said that In 2015, adults between the ages of 25 and 34 were more than twice as likely as adults aged 45 to 64 to lack health insurance coverage - 17.9 percent compared with 8.8 percent.
""In 2015, 27.7 percent of Hispanic, 14.4 percent of non-Hispanic black, 8.7 percent of non-Hispanic white, and 7.9 percent of non-Hispanic Asian adults aged 18-64 lacked health insurance coverage at the time of interview,"" the report said.
""Significant decreases in the percentage of uninsured adults were observed between 2013 and 2015 for Hispanic, non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, and non-Hispanic Asian adults,"" the report said.
""Hispanic adults had the greatest percentage point decrease in the uninsured rate between 2013 and 2015,"" falling from 40.6 percent to 27.7 percent, according to the report.",False,This email appears to be a legitimate news update from CNBC discussing the record low for US health uninsured rate as a result of the impact of Obamacare.

"Hi all,
Think it'd be a good idea for us to hit the Trump/Ryan joint statement, and get our perspective in stories. Drafted something below.
DNC National Press Secretary Mark Paustenbach issued the following statement:
""Donald Trump and Speaker Ryan didn't have to issue a joint statement for the American people to know that they are on the same page and believe in the same dangerous and divisive agenda.  The fact of the matter is that despite some personal disagreements, they both support the old Republican playbook of cutting taxes for the rich at the expense of middle-class families, they both oppose measures like equal pay and paid family leave, and they both support reckless policies that would only to drag America back into a recession. We simply can't afford to go back to losing 800,000 jobs a month as the last Republican president left office.""

"Hi Peck et al,
Thanks for your note about the Africa borehole reconstructions, along
with the correspondence with Jason Smerdon. In my e-mail to you on
April 18,2006 I had indicated that the African work was unpublished.
However, I had forgotten that the Nature paper by Huang, Pollack and
Shen (Temperature trends over the past five centuries reconstructed
from borehole temperatures, Nature 403, pp 756-758, 2000) actually
showed the reconstructions for both southern Africa and Australia as
bar graphs of century-long changes in Figure 3 of that paper. The
figure displaying both the Africa and Australia borehole
reconstructions that appears in the FAR draft (Figure 6.12? or was it
6.11?) shows temperature vs. time for five centuries, a display that
differs from the bar-graphs in the Nature paper only in format, not
data.
Inasmuch as there have been no additions to the datasets since that
paper, it seems that we can correctly say that the reconstructions for
southern Africa and Australia have both been published in the Nature
(2000) paper. There is nothing ""wrong"" or outdated with either of those
reconstructions. We have, in addition, a newer and more expansive paper
about Australia alone (discussing the same reconstruction as appeared
in the Nature paper), now in press in the Journal of Quaternary
Science.  This paper was already mentioned in the e-mail of April 18,
2006, which I will paste at the end of this message.
Other questions?
Cheers,
Henry

Hi Keith (and Peck and Eystein),
I have recently been sent the current draft of the IPCC FAR by the US
Global Change
Research Program, asking for comments on the draft. This is the first
time I have seen
this product since we were feverishly exchanging e-mails in February.
Let me call to your
attention some small but not insignificant corrections to be made to
the next draft.
Page 6-33, Section 6.6.1.2, line 22.  The title of this section (in
italics) should be
changed to ""What do ground surface temperature reconstructions derived
from subsurface
temperature measurements tell us?""
Page 6-33, lines 49 and 52, there is a reference (Smerdon et al., in press).
This paper has now been published, so substitute ""2006"" for ""in press"",
and in the list
of references the citation should include the following:
J. Geophys. Res. 111, D07101, doi:10.1029/2004JD005578
Page 6-34, lines 43 and 44. This section is dealing with the southern
hemisphere. The
sentence ""...these both indicate unusually warm conditions prevailing
in the 20th century
(Pollack and Smerdon, 2004)""  , and the reference therein, are both incorrect.
The ground surface temperature changes over the last 500 years DO NOT
indicate unusually
warm conditions prevailing in the 20th century in Australia and
southern Africa. This is
because the unusually warm conditions developed late in the century,
after most of the
boreholes had already been logged.  What the borehole reconstruction
for Australia does
show is very good correspondence with the Cook et al (2000)
reconstruction for Tasmania
and the Cook et al. (2002) recon for New Zealand. The Australia work is
described in a
manuscript “Five centuries of Climate Change in Australia: The View
from Underground” by
Pollack, Huang and Smerdon now under review in the Journal of
Quaternary Science. The
Africa work is unpublished.
Is this e-mail to you sufficient to activate these changes? Or should I
submit these
comments to the US Government Review Panel? If I am to submit to the
latter, they require
all comments to be filed by May 9.
Cheers,
Henry

"Hello Jonathan, Keith, and Eystein:
I want to make a reminder about the embargo for release of the WRA Science comment article.  Please do not disseminate this article to anyone else, or discuss it publically until it is actually published, which I know Science wants to do soon.  I still believe citation is appropriate, and I have asked for clarification on this from the editors.  I will let you know what/if I hear from them.
FYI, this issue is also related to the NAS committee looking into last millenium surface temperature reconstructions this week, as I think you are aware.  Today, the NAS staff person working with this committee said he talked to Jesse Smith of Science about this article, who mentioned he could say nothing, but referred the staff person to me.  I was not really sure what this meant, and so I did not say anything specific on this myself, to ensure that I would not be in conflict with the embargo.  That is where it stands in that arena for now.
As you saw in the message from Steve Schneider that I copied to you, however, there is no embargo of any kind on use of the Climatic Change article.

Okay....Catchup unseen is something that I don't use often, but i can
certainly reproduce this.  I'll dig into it.  It's probably simple.
