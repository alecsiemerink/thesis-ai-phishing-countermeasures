# GenAI and Phishing countermeasures
This repository contains the code and datasets used for collecting data in the thesis "The Dual-Edged Sword of Generative AI in Phishing" by Alec Siemerink, Utrecht University. This study explores the capabilities of generative AI models, particularly GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, in detecting and combating phishing attacks.

## Datasets
