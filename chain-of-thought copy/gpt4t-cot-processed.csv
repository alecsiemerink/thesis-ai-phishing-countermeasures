Firstly, there's a lack of urgency; the transition to electronic pay stubs is a planned corporate change with a reasonable deadline, not an immediate demand. Secondly, there is no direct threat or fear inducement, merely a notification of a shift in company policy with options provided for employees who prefer physical pay stubs. Offers of enticement or deals that seem too good to be true are absent. While the email mentions authority (Enron and specific contact persons), it's done in a manner consistent with corporate communications, including real contact information without demanding any sensitive personal info through suspicious links. Recent events exploitation, reputable brand misuse for trust, promises of immediate rewards, and curiosity piques with vague promises are not present. The described procedures and contact details appear legitimate, aiming for transparency rather than deception. Despite containing a clickable link, the context justifies its presence without red flags like vague URL domains or mismatched hyperlink text. Thus, aligning with the provided framework, this email seems more informational and company-specific rather than a phishing attempt. However, caution is always advised, especially with links, and verifying through known channels is a best practice."

Firstly, it creates a strong sense of urgency by stating that the recipient's account has been suspended and requires immediate action to avoid further consequences. This tactic is designed to pressure the recipient into acting hastily, making it more likely for them to overlook potential red flags. Secondly, it employs authority bias by posing as PayPal, a well-known and respected entity, to lend credibility to the demand. The message also entices the recipient with the promise of restoring their account functionality, playing on their desire to regain access and resolve the issue swiftly. Moreover, the inclusion of a hyperlink directing the recipient to a 'secure server webform' is a common phishing tactic used to harvest personal information. The email also contains spelling and grammar mistakes (e.g., 'replay' instead of 'reply'), which are often present in phishing emails. Additionally, the message urges the recipient not to respond directly, further limiting their opportunity to verify the legitimacy of the email through direct communication with PayPal. Combined, these tactics closely align with known phishing patterns, particularly the exploitation of urgency, authority, and the lure of resolution through a suspicious link. Based on these indicators, the email is highly likely to be a phishing attempt."

michaell",False,"The email focuses on advertising discounted prices on printer supplies, comparing its lower prices with those of original manufacturers. It does not exploit psychological traits or cognitive biases typically associated with phishing attempts, such as creating an urgent need to act, inducing fear, falsely claiming authority, or tempting with vague promises.

It mentions a long-standing business since 1992, aiming to build credibility rather than falsely claim authority or expertise. The email also provides an option to opt-out, which is a common practice in legitimate marketing emails but less so in phishing. There are no direct requests for sensitive personal information, financial details, or actions that could compromise the recipient's security.

Firstly, it creates a sense of urgency by informing the recipient that their mailbox has exceeded its storage limit, suggesting that they won't be able to receive new emails until action is taken. This urgency is a common tactic used in phishing to pressure the recipient into acting quickly without giving them time to think critically about the email's legitimacy. The email also prompts the recipient to 'Re-Validate' by clicking on a provided link, which is a red flag for phishing attempts, as legitimate organizations typically advise against clicking on links for security purposes and instead recommend visiting their website directly. Furthermore, the email lacks personalization, which is often the case with phishing emails sent out in mass to ensnare as many victims as possible. The warning about the email system's inability to scan attached files for viruses, despite there being no mention of an attachment in the main body of the email, adds an element of incongruence and could be an attempt to exploit the curiosity effect, making recipients wonder about the nature of the supposed attachment. Although the email includes a detailed signature block to appear credible, such details can be easily fabricated. Considering these aspects, the email aligns with common phishing strategies by exploiting urgency, offering a vague solution via a suspicious link, and attempting to appear legitimate through detailed contact information. Therefore, it is concluded that this email is likely a phishing attempt."
"Hi everyone
I have been through the ideas and offer a few (aptly non organised) comments. First Phil is
away and will not be able to comment until later.
First, the project needs more explicit focus. The call will focused on natural variability
. We are offering a detailed analysis of the variability of climate in the Alpine Region
that focuses on CLIVAR timescales - basically very high resolution and not extending much
beyond a few centuries. The project incorporates instrumental , model and palaeodata . The
inter-relationships between these will be studied to gain an understanding of the nature
and mechanisms of the climate variability - but is this enough. I feel it needs to be
linked with a strong element of understanding the range of social/economic impacts of this
variability.
Perhaps looking at aspects such as avalanches, forest damage, floods, tourism etc.? I
merely put this out as a straw man . I feel the EC are putting a lot of emphasis on this
aspect of research and incorporating research and researchers in these or similar areas
will be a big plus.
As for the specific points in the brainstorming document -
The Dendro aspect :
I think it is essential to update the Alpine tree-ring chronologies that are available .
This is because they are a proven asset but many questions regarding tree-productivity (in
relation to observed 20th century climate variability) simply can not be addressed without
doing this. Many were collected over 20 years ago. The additional data would then allow new
processing techniques to be employed and vital questions concerning the changing responses
of tree-growth to explored. The most efficient way to do this is to involve several groups
working in the Alps , (Thank you for sending the Thesis by Giorgio Strumia which is
certainly a very impressive piece of work) I would think Rupert Wimmer's group and the
Birmensdorf group would be ideal (Fritz Schweingruber has retired but Jan Esper has joined
them in his place - I can ask them to be involved but this depends on what the group here
think are the priorities and how much we see as the overall budget and institutional
allocations). I should say here that I think we would require money for a single person who
could , if it is  agreed, work on aspects of tree-ring processing and relationships with
climate in association with the other tree-ring groups, but also work with the climate and
model data , especially with a view to exploring the statistical inter-relationships and
dynamical associations between the different climate data sets. There is also the French
tree-ring group at Marseille? Perhaps though not all need to partners - ALSO I am thinking
of putting together a European Tree-ring project (or suggesting it as part of a large
European integrated proxy study of Holocene variability) so if this happened there could be
a link between it (involving some of the groups mentioned) and this proposal. The Swiss
might be interested to produce selected site tree-ring density/updating which I think would
be very valuable and I will speak to them without commitment as you ask.
As for some of the climate analysis possibilities mentioned, I very much like the ideas of
detailed ,local climate comparisons with the larger CRU (and CRUder!) data. We are very
interested in the association between time dependence in the relationships between
circulation changes and changes in Temp. and Prec. Also changes in the nature of climate
seasonality , and also extreme events (frost frequency , drought, intense rainfall). The
detailed analyses of these characteristics also compliments the interpretational work on
the tree-ring and glacier mass balance (and socio economic foci) data.
As for the glacier work - is not a huge effort already going into this? I think it is
important but does it fit as well ? The work proposed would have to be distinguished from
other ongoing efforts - though I do like the idea of linking the geomorphological evidence
of past glacier change (moraines , pro-glacial sediment data?) with reconstructed glacier
volume changes , where the reconstructions are based on new long instrumental data , and
palaeodata (temp. and precip.) used to drive a model of the glacier volume.  Our German (or
Julie) colleagues can point to such work based on GCM output . My colleague here (Sarah
Raper) has also done this sort of work but using a very simple model to estimate past
Storglaciaren (in Sweden) volume changes  and her results imply that these models must be
forward driven and not based on simple regression analysis using temperature and
precipitation to estimate past mass balance.
The future aspects of the discussion are important - and it is true that the previous EC
call dealt with modelling and scenarios of future changes. Here, I believe the use of
models should be strictly limited to understanding natural /current variability and change.
There is no benefit in going for a 2 year project - I strongly urge 3. I also would find a
meeting difficult. I am away from 17-29 July, and 11-25 August, and in meetings during
7-10th July and 26-31st August.
Phil will be back here next week and will no doubt comment in more detail on the
instrumental analysis aspects then.
Very best wishes to all

Friends,
As announced last Friday, we want to open a first round of brainstorming about the
contents of our project. We have collected what we have received from You so far and
have it mixed with our own ideas (file Brainstorming-1.doc). It does not have a nice
structure and there are still a number of question marks, as You will see.
Please add things where you think something is missing and please feel free to tell us
which points make no sense, or are too ambitious or simply too much work.
Please consider also the ""how to do it"" (state of the art methods, new approaches to
solve problems, other data than those mentioned, other topics.....).
Please try also to find Your position in the project, tell us what You would prefer to
do....
Please try to consider whether we would have to include other groups in terms of
scientific potential and/or in terms of data (For example: Keith Briffa you mentioned
Fritz Schweingruber as the leading data holder of Alpine tree-ring data. Do you think we
should ask him to join us, or could You use his data also without him being a contractor
of the project? In case You want him in the project could we kindly ask you to contact
him, being much more familiar with him and with the tree-ring topic than we are?)
We would be glad to receive a very short answer from everybody within this week, because
from June 30th to July 15th all the three of us will not be at the institute.
For more detailed considerations and answers You have more time, it would be nice to be
able to study them after our return by mid of July. But please use also the
possibilities to contact  the other groups - the sooner we integrate to a group the
better it is.
Our time-table for the rest of the time until October:
July 16th to August 14th: We are at the institute, hoping to bring the project into a
near to final version what concerns the scientific content
August 15th to August 28th: Ice core conference at Kangerlussuaq (Greenland)
August 29th to September 17th: We are at the institute most of the time. We hope this
will be the time to elaborate the EU-shaped complete version.
September 18th to September 22nd: Big events going on in Vienna which may cut down our
time for the project (150th anniversary of our institute, Climate conference DACH-2001
(in German))
September 24th to October: Time reserved for all the things that could not be done yet
in spite of our time table
Could each of You please inform us about Your time table during summer and autumn?
A question to all of You: How do You think about one 2-days meeting this Summer or in
early September? What place do You prefer? If it is Austria we would have two low cost
possibilities: 1): at our institute  and 2) (more adventurous): At the
Sonnblick-observatory (You do not have to have Alpinistic experience, we have a private
cable car going up)
Some remaining questions:
Should we try a 2-years or a 3-years project?
Can everybody live with roughly 300.000 Euro (This would result into somewhere between
1.5 and two millions, which we heard is a magnitude preferred by the commission). Please
consider not only the sum of money but also how to spend it and how to fill it with a
reasonable equivalent in work amount.
What is your feeling about the ""Climate variability atlas of the Alps""? Is it good to
have one main deliverable like that or should we better produce a number of smaller
things?
One last technical remark:  Please send your comments and mails not only to Vienna, but
also to the other groups (or at least to those You believe would be interested in what
You write). I do not think this would spoil too much our mail boxes and it has the
advantage to include the whole intellectual power of our group into the construction
phase of the proposal.
Looking forward to Your replies, ideas, time tables and anything else
With best regards
Reinhard

"Dear Tom,
Thanks for forwarding the message from John Christy. Excuse me for being
so blunt, but John's message is just a load of utter garbage.
I got a laugh out of John's claim that Santer et al. (2008) was ""poorly
done"". This was kind of ironic coming from a co-author of the Douglass
et al. (2007) paper, which used a fundamentally flawed statistical test
to compare modeled and observed tropospheric temperature trends. To my
knowledge, John has NEVER acknowledged that Douglass et al. used a
flawed statistical test to reach incorrect conclusions - despite
unequivocal evidence from the ""synthetic data"" experiments in Santer et
al. (2008) that the Douglass et al. ""robust consistency"" test was simply
wrong. Unbelievably, Christy continues to assert that the results of
Douglass et al. (2007) ""still stand"". I can only shake my head in
amazement at such intellectual dishonesty. I guess the best form of
defense is a ""robust"" attack.
So how does John support his contention that Santer et al. (2008) was
""poorly done""? He begins by stating that:
""Santer et al. 2008 used ERSST data which I understand has now been
changed in a way that discredits the conclusion there"".
Maybe you or Tom Peterson or Dick Reynolds can enlighten me on this one.
How exactly have NOAA ERSST surface data changed? Recall that Santer et
al. (2008) actually used two different versions of the ERSST data
(version 2 and version 3). We also used HadISST sea-surface temperature
data, and combined SSTs and land 2m temperature data from HadCRUT3v. In
other words, we used four different observational estimates of surface
temperature changes. Our bottom-line conclusion (no significant
discrepancy between modeled and observed lower-tropospheric lapse-rate
trends) was not sensitive to our choice of observed surface temperature
dataset.
John next assets that:
""Haimberger's v1.2-1.4 (of the radiosonde data) are clearly spurious due
to the error in ECMWF as published many places"".
I'll let Leo Haimberger respond to that one. And if v1.2 of Leo's data
is ""clearly spurious"", why did John Christy agree to be a co-author on
the Douglass et al. paper which uses upper-air data from v1.2?
Santer et al. (2008) comprehensively examined structural uncertainties
in the observed upper-air datasets. They looked at two different
satellite and seven different radiosonde-based estimates of tropospheric
temperature change. As in the case of the surface temperature data,
getting the statistical test right was much more important (in terms of
the bottom-line conclusions) than the choice of observational upper-air
dataset.
Christy's next criticism of our IJoC paper is even more absurd. He
states that:
""Santer et al. 2008 asked a very different question...than we did. Our
question was ""Does the IPCC BEST ESTIMATE agree with the Best Data
(including RSS)?"" Answer - No.  Santer et al. asked, ""Does ANY IPCC
model agree with ANY data set?"" ... I think you can see the difference.
Actually, we asked and answered BOTH of these questions. ""Tests with
individual model realizations"" are described in Section 4.1 of Santer et
al. (2008), while Section 4.2 covers ""Tests with multi-model
ensemble-mean trend"". As should be obvious - even to John Christy - we
did NOT just compare observations with results from individual models.
For both types of test (""individual model"" and ""multi-model average""),
we found that, if one applied appropriate statistical tests (which
Douglass et al. failed to do), there was no longer a serious discrepancy
between modeled and observed trends in tropical lapse rates or in
tropical tropospheric temperatures.
Again, I find myself shaking my head in amazement. How can John make
such patently false claims about our paper? The kindest interpretation
is that he is a complete idiot, and has not even bothered to read Santer
et al. (2008) before making erroneous criticisms of it. The less kind
interpretation is that he is deliberately lying.
A good scientist is willing to acknowledge the errors he or she commits
(such as applying an inappropriate statistical test). John Christy is
not a good scientist. I'm not a religious man, but I'm sure willing to
thank some higher authority that Dr. John Christy is not the
""gatekeeper"" of what constitutes sound science.
I hope you don't mind, Tom, but I'm copying this email to some of the
other co-authors of the Santer et al. (2008) IJoC paper. They deserve to
know about the kind of disinformation Christy is spreading.
With best regards,

It creates a sense of urgency by saying that the recipient's access to sensitive account features will be limited and that action is needed to restore account access. This is a common tactic in phishing emails to make the recipient act hastily without fully considering the legitimacy of the request. It mentions a scenario involving 'different computers' accessing the account and 'multiple password failures' as reasons for account limitation, inducing fear of unauthorized access to the recipient's PayPal account, which is another red flag pointing towards a phishing attempt. The email further asks the recipient to visit an unspecified link to complete 'Security Measures,' a vague instruction which is typical of phishing scams designed to extract personal information or login credentials. Additionally, the email warns not to reply, discouraging direct communication that could expose the fraudulent nature of the request. The language used, particularly the finality of 'terminating all privileges of your account,' seeks to exploit authority bias, suggesting that a reputable organization (PayPal) is mandating compliance. The lack of a specific, verifiable link (the link is mentioned but not provided) to restore account access and the fact that the email discourages replies by stating that mail sent to the address 'cannot be answered' are tactics to avoid validation of the email's authenticity. Considering these points and the overall context and tone of the email, it closely follows known phishing patterns, indicating it is likely a phishing attempt."

The use of an Authority Bias is evident in the signature from the 'Bank of America Security Center,' attempting to establish trust and compel compliance through the perception of official authority. Additionally, the instruction to download and open a form from an email is a common phishing technique designed to trick recipients into installing malware or revealing sensitive information. The email's tone is pressing and authoritative, falsely claiming an association with a reputable financial institution to elicit a sense of trust and urgency. There's also a lack of specificity about the 'issue on your account,' which is another red flag; legitimate bank communications typically provide more detail or direct the customer to secure known channels.

8745fsms0-224l12",True,"This email exhibits several classic phishing characteristics, exploiting psychological traits and cognitive biases to entice recipients. Firstly, it leverages the 'Enticement with Desire' bias by promising a 'Real And Legitimate Opportunity To Make Some SERIOUS MONEY' without the need for selling, phone calls, recruiting, or attending meetings. This offer seems too good to be true and plays on the desire for easy money. The urgency and simplicity of the message ('ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS ENROLL...ANYONE CAN DO THIS!') could also trigger the 'Hyperbolic Discounting' cognitive bias, as it suggests an immediate reward with minimal effort, overshadowing rational assessment of potential long-term consequences. Moreover, the lack of specific information about the company or the nature of the business, combined with a vague and broad appeal ('No Experience Required'), serves to heighten curiosity ('Curiosity Effect'), enticing recipients to visit the provided link without providing substantive details about the offer. The email's attempt to legitimize its reach by claiming the recipient is receiving the message due to a prior online activity ('You are receiving this e-mail because you have purchased something online or signed up for information over the last 6 months') could exploit the 'Recency Effect', making it seem relevant and timely. However, this is a common tactic used in phishing emails to fabricate a sense of legitimacy and connection. Additionally, the offer to be removed from the mailing list by sending a request could be a tactic to confirm valid, active email addresses for further phishing attempts. The combination of these characteristics, particularly the lack of specific information, the reliance on high-pressure sales tactics, and vague promises, strongly indicates that this email is likely a phishing attempt."

Firstly, it employs a sense of urgency by claiming that the recipient's email account is nearing its storage limit and will be deleted if no action is taken. This is designed to pressurize the user into acting hastily ('If we do not receive a reply from you within 24 hours, Your mailbox will be suspended'). Secondly, it induces fear by threatening the loss of the ability to send and receive emails and the deletion of the account from the servers, imposing a negative consequence for inaction. Thirdly, the email requests the recipient to 'update your mail box quota' by providing login information via a link, which is a common phishing tactic to harvest user credentials. The message falsely claims authority by signing off as 'System Administrator,' attempting to exploit authority bias to elicit compliance. The language used ('to avoid this problem, you need to') is pressing and authoritative, aiming to convince the recipient of the legitimacy of the request. There's also a lack of specific details, such as the recipient's name or the email service provider's name, which is typical in phishing attempts to target a broad audience. The combination of these elements—creating urgency, threatening negative outcomes, exploiting authority bias, and asking for personal information—aligns closely with known phishing strategies. Therefore, this email is likely a phishing attempt."

in response to Nadia's message and our talk - consider the following as regards title and
objectives
Title
The precedence of Ecological  Responses to 20th Century Climate changes in Arctic Lakes and
Trees
Suggested Objectives
We will quantify how the changes in 20th century Arctic climate (including mean and
variability) are reflected in recent and past lake sediment records. We will determine the
response of lake ecosystem  parameters and the relationships with specific climatic
controls.
We will define the character of variability in different natural archives contained in
dated sediments reaching back over 2000 years. We will generate well-calibrated ,
high-resolution (decadal to centennial time scales) estimates of past summer climate
variability over this time in western Arctic Siberia.
We will compare the lake sediment data with evidence of tree-growth and associated summer
climate changes , based on selected updating of an extensive, existing network of
chronologies, including long sub-fossil series extending back more than 4000 years in Yamal
and Taimyr. These  data (with perfect inter-annual dating accuracy) will be reprocessed to
provide summer temperatures specifically representative of annual, decadal and centennial
timescales.
We will determine (for the first time) the extent to which the independent proxy-based
summer climate  histories concur or disagree and explore the extent to which they
demonstrate the precedence of  recent (20th century ) climate trends  in a multi-millennial
context. By comparing this evidence with the output of state-of-the-art GCM experiments ,
simulating climate changes in the Arctic over the last 500 to 1000 years, we will explore
the degree to which recent changes in Arctic lakes (and tree-growth rates) are attributable
to anthropogenic as opposed to natural climate changes.

There's no sense of urgency, fear-inducing threats, offers that entice undeservedly, false claims of authority (beyond their actual academic positions), or exploitation of recent events for urgency. The language used is professional and pertains to a specific academic collaboration concerning climate change research in the Arctic, discussing details about a grant submission and requesting information related to ECHO-G experiments for their project.

Firstly, it creates a sense of urgency by claiming the recipient's mailbox has exceeded its storage limit and requires immediate action to avoid account loss. This tactic pressures the recipient into clicking the provided link without careful consideration. The email also employs the threat of losing the account within 24 hours, exploiting fear to coerce the recipient into compliance.

The instruction to click on a link and 'submit, as we try to verify your account' is a classic phishing tactic, likely leading to a fraudulent website designed to harvest personal and financial details. The email also exhibits authority bias by masquerading as an official communication from Chase, a reputable financial institution, to gain trust and compliance from the recipient. Although there is a vague mention of an IP address and ISP host to make the claim seem legitimate and specific, the lack of any direct contact options besides the suspicious link ('* Please do not respond to this email as your reply will not be received') further supports the phishing conclusion. The combination of urgency, fear, authority bias, and the suspicious directive to not respond directly to the email aligns closely with known phishing strategies, leading to the conclusion that this email is highly likely to be a phishing attempt."
"Pennsylvania voters overwhelmingly oppose Sen. Pat Toomey's obstruction of Chief Judge Merrick Garland's Supreme Court nomination.
Today, the Constitutional Responsibility Project released its first television ad. The 30-second spot
showcases Sen. Toomey's (R-PA) unprecedented refusal to consider any Supreme Court nominee and calls on Sen. Toomey to put the Constitution before his politics. The ad will air in the Philadelphia media market over the Senate recess.
Additionally, the Constitutional Responsibility Project, in conjunction with the League of Conservation Voters, released a new survey of Pennsylvania voters conducted by Hart Research. The survey found that Pennsylvania voters support giving Judge Garland a hearing and an up-or-down vote and strongly disapprove of the positon Senate Republican leadership has taken on this matter.
""This poll shows that Pennsylvanians strongly believe that Senator Toomey and others must give the president's nominee both a fair hearing and a timely vote, and LCV members couldn't agree more.  Nearly 150,000 of them have signed a petition calling on the Senate to do its job, including nearly 5,000 in Pennsylvania alone,"" said Tiernan Sittenfeld, Senior Vice President of Government Affairs, League of Conservation Voters.
A full memo from Hart Research Associates outlining the survey's findings and polling method can be found HERE
.
Key findings from the Constitutional Responsibility Project and the League of Conservation Voters survey include:
*   By a margin of 56 percent to 37 percent, Pennsylvania voters say the Senate should hold hearings and give Chief Judge Garland an up-or-down-vote.
*   Independent voters agree with this position by an event larger margin - 60 percent to 36 percent.
*   After voters hear the pros and cons on Senator Toomey's positon on the Supreme Court vacancy, feelings toward him become notably less favorable.
*   Independents move from a small net positive view of Toomey (24 percent positive, 18 percent negative) to a large net negative opinion of him (24 percent positive, 50 percent negative).
*   At the start of the survey, 43 percent of voters said they were inclined to vote for Senator Toomey over his Democratic challenger. After being told about his stance on Judge Garland's nomination, 46 percent of voters said they are less likely to support Senator Toomey.
*   16 percent of voters said they would be more open to voting for the Democratic challenger as a result of Senator Toomey's opposition to hearings and a vote for Judge Garland.
Wisconsin voters do not approve of Sen. Johnson's Supreme Court obstruction.
Roll Call
reports on a new poll finding that Sen. Ron Johnson's (R-WI) continued refusal to consider Chief Judge Garland's nomination runs counter to the values of Wisconsin voters.
""60 percent of likely Wisconsin voters want to see the president and Senate take action to fill the vacancy now... Roughly half of voters felt that by blocking Obama's nominee, senators were ""trying to advance their party's agenda rather than doing what is right for the country.""
After meeting with Chief Merrick Garland yesterday, Sen. Gary Peters lauds his ""impeccable legal credentials.
The Detroit News
reports:
Sen. Peters (D-MI): ""He comes to this nomination with ... impeccable legal credentials. On top of that, he has the benefit of already being confirmed for his current position with broad bipartisan support. So this is the type of candidate that certainly deserves to have a hearing.""""
Chief Judge Garland is exactly the type of jurist we want on the Court.
Former U.S. solicitor general Ted Olson writes in the Wall Street Journal
:
Ted Olson, former U.S. solicitor general: ""Mr. Garland is extraordinarily well qualified...Throughout his career, he has impressed his colleagues and his legal adversaries with his leadership, sense of fairness, and respect for the law. He has been a judge for 19 years and is now chief judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, considered by many to be the second-most-important court in the country. Scalia and three current justices also served on the D.C. circuit. By temperament, character and qualifications, Judge Garland is precisely the kind of jurist we want on the Supreme Court.  For Republicans, there is much to recommend giving Mr. Garland a good look, a respectful hearing and a vote on the merits.""
Chief Judge Garland will approach the legal issues that face the disability community with thought and care.
Michael Waterston, an expert in disability and civil rights law, reviewed Chief Judge Garland's record and found him to be a thoughtful and fair jurist.
Michael Waterstone, disability and civil rights law expert: ""How will Justice Garland rule on the important issues facing the disability community - things like whether websites need to be accessible to individuals who are blind, or how far employers need to go in providing accommodations to workers with disabilities, or whether voters with disabilities are entitled to secret and independent ballots, like everyone else? I don't know...But I do feel confident that Justice Garland would approach the questions carefully and thoughtfully, and without a predefined agenda against the rights of people with disabilities.""[Loyola Law School, 4/28/16

###",False,"The email provided contains information concerning political campaigns and public opinions regarding specific U.S. senators' actions related to a Supreme Court nomination. It does not exhibit typical phishing characteristics such as inducing a sense of urgency, threatening the recipient, or enticing with irresistible offers. The email primarily focuses on political advocacy, urging action in relation to a public matter rather than seeking personal information or promoting dubious offers. There's no attempt to falsely claim authority, exploit recent events for urgency, or lure with promises of immediate gain. The content is directed towards informing the audience about political events and encouraging participation in democratic processes rather than deceiving them for malicious gain. Based on this analysis, the conclusion is that the email is not a phishing attempt."

All you have to do is pay in �1,000 in the course of a month and apply online.
The offer is only valid for a limited time, so if you want to make the most of our 2008 Year gift, apply now!",True,"The email exhibits several characteristics and employs tactics indicative of a phishing attempt, leveraging psychological traits and cognitive biases to lure the recipient into a deceptive action. First, the email entices with desire by promising �2000 cash for new or switching customers, which is a significant amount likely to attract attention and interest. This plays on the enticement with desire trait, offering something too good to be true to encourage hasty actions. Secondly, a sense of urgency is manufactured with the statement that the offer is only valid for a limited time, urging the recipient to act quickly without giving them ample time to consider the legitimacy of the offer or the potential consequences of their actions. This urgency is further emphasized with phrases such as 'apply now!' and the mention of it being a 2008 Year gift, associating the offer with a specific time frame to compound the urgency. Additionally, the email lacks specific details about the bank's official website and provides a nondescript `>>> Apply online` link without a clear URL, which is a common phishing tactic to lead individuals to a fraudulent site designed to steal personal information. The combination of these tactics—enticing with a high reward, creating a sense of urgency, and vague instructions on how to claim the offer—are characteristic of phishing attempts designed to exploit psychological traits for malicious purposes. Considering these elements, the email aligns closely with known phishing patterns and strategies, leading to the conclusion that it is indeed a phishing attempt."

PayPal Email ID PP059",True,"The email exhibits several signs that indicate it might be a phishing attempt. Firstly, there's a sense of urgency created by suggesting the recipient needs to confirm an email address by clicking a provided link and entering their password, a tactic often used in phishing to rush victims into taking action without thinking. Secondly, it exploits authority bias by presenting the request as if it's coming from PayPal, a trusted authority in financial transactions, to make the request seem legitimate. Additionally, inducing fear by threatening is subtly employed by implying a problem with the recipient's PayPal account that needs immediate resolution, prompting action to 'protect' one's account. The language used to direct the recipient to 'click here and login to your account' coupled with the request to enter a password on a following page is highly suspicious for a company like PayPal, which, as mentioned in the same email, 'will never ask you to enter your password in an email.' Furthermore, the inclusion of a non-secure and unrelated email (creative.mind@earthlink.com) as a contact point raises additional red flags. Despite the email's attempt to mimic legitimate PayPal communications, including security advice, these characteristics align closely with common phishing strategies attempting to deceive recipients into providing sensitive information. Therefore, the conclusion is that the email is likely a phishing attempt."

Specifically, it lacks a sense of urgency, fear-inducing threats, enticement with too-good-to-be-true offers, false authority claims, exploitation of recent events, promises of immediate rewards, or attempts to pique curiosity through vague or intriguing propositions. The message appears to be a simple inquiry about the availability of the recipient, followed by a generic Yahoo signature promoting its spam protection features, which is typical for emails from the early 2000s when Yahoo Mail was widely used. The absence of requests for personal information, clickable links, or attachments further reduces the likelihood of it being a phishing attempt. Therefore, the analysis concludes that this email is not a phishing attempt, given the lack of phishing characteristics and the context of the message."

©2007 JPMorgan Chase & Co",True,"The email exhibits several characteristics and implements psychological traits and cognitive biases that are common in phishing attempts. Firstly, it employs the tactic of 'Enticement with Desire' by offering a $20.00 reward simply for completing a survey. This too-good-to-be-true offer serves as the immediate reward meant to lure the recipient into taking action. Secondly, the email utilizes authority by masquerading as a communication from Chase Bank. This exploits the 'Authority Bias,' making the recipient more likely to trust the content and follow through with the requested action. Additionally, the urge to click on a provided link to participate in the survey can be seen as exploiting the 'Curiosity Effect,' aiming to make the recipient curious about the survey and the promised reward. The language used ('kindly asks,' 'quick and easy 5 questions survey') is designed to make the request appear harmless and beneficial, emphasizing the lack of risk ('non-sensitive and anonymous' information). Moreover, the referenced security measures ('stored in our secure database for maximum 7 days') attempt to mitigate concerns about data privacy. Considering the common phishing patterns of enticing victims with rewards, falsifying authority, and pushing users towards immediate action (clicking a link), this email closely aligns with known phishing strategies. Therefore, based on the identified traits and biases, along with the deceptive nature of the offer and the impersonation of a reputable entity, it's concluded that the email is likely a phishing attempt."

Firstly, it creates a sense of urgency by warning the recipient that their Amazon account 'could be suspended' if they don't act quickly. This tactic is designed to pressure the recipient into making hasty decisions without proper verification of the email's legitimacy. Secondly, the email induces fear by suggesting that 'possible unauthorized listings' have been found, thus leading the recipient to worry about their account security and potentially comply with the email's instructions out of fear of losing their account or facing further repercussions. The request for the recipient to 'complete the form below' with their correct information, including potentially sensitive financial details, is a classic phishing strategy aimed at harvesting personal and financial information. Lastly, the language and tone used in the email, such as 'We regret to inform you' and emphasizing the need to resolve 'your problems', are manipulative, aiming to provoke anxiety and a rapid response. The email also attempts to appear authoritative by signing off as the 'Safeharbor Department Amazon, Inc.' and by mimicking Amazon's privacy policy language, exploiting the Authority Bias.

This urgency is a common tactic to rush the recipient into clicking links without due diligence. Furthermore, the email includes a direct link with the prompt to 'Click here to unlock your account,' which is a red flag for phishing emails, as legitimate banks usually instruct customers to log into their account through the official website without providing direct links. The email also exploits authority bias by posing as an official communication from Citizens Bank, attempting to leverage the bank's authority to gain the recipient's compliance. Additionally, the instruction at the end of the email not to reply because the email address cannot be answered is suspicious.

Firstly, it employs the Enticement with Desire strategy, offering a 'complimentary three-night stay' in various attractive locations. This is a classic example of providing something too good to be true to lure recipients into responding to the email. Secondly, there's a clear use of the Sense of Urgency tactic, as it pressures the recipient to act quickly by stating the offer expires '72 hours from the date of delivery.' This is designed to make the recipient act hastily, potentially overlooking the email's dubious nature. The email also tries to create an air of exclusivity, suggesting that the offer is made only to a 'very select group of individuals,' which can be seen as playing on the Halo Effect by implying that the recipients are special or chosen. Furthermore, the provision of a 'remove me' feature attempting to comply with anti-spam laws (citing a specific but not universally recognized bill) and asserting that the recipient had previously expressed interest in such promotions seeks to exploit Authority Bias by appearing compliant and legitimate. However, the excessive use of caps lock, vague promises, and a general lack of specific, verifiable detail adds to the suspicion. Based on these identified characteristics and the overall implausible nature of the offer, the conclusion is that this email is likely a phishing attempt."
"Dear friends of the Imprint - SSC,
After seeing the evaluation summary of our
proposal, and not least the same for Millennium,
it is clear to me that we have been very badly
treated, first by the public advice from the
Commission in Utrecht who advised the community
to create a proposal which we did, but which is
orthogonal to what they now have decided to
negotiate, later by the random way we were
reviewed and the many inconsistencies in the
evaluation. Compared to this the Millennium
review was full of subjective phrases and a
number of negative aspects were glossed over.
The review is an insult, and it appears likely
that elements in the panel bear some grudges
against our community. In order to get the 0.5
point difference between Imprint and Millennium
they had to give a number of very imbalanced
statements. They also had to raise the management
score of Millennium to 4 by the xtended panel
despite critisisms by the reviewers  that the
management was not well laid out.
I feel that the review was very biased and the
result is that they will probably fund a project
with only limited relevance to the call, and miss
a major opportunity of integrating European
paleoclimate research and climate modelling and
create a new major step forward.
We have been advised to send a formal letter of
complaint to the Commission, asking for a renewed
evaluation, not because we think there is a good
chance that it will lead to much, but we think it
is important that they know that they have upset
a community consisting of top level European
scientists, This may help us in the longer term.
The advice I have got is to send this to Pierre
Valette, co-signed by the key partners, both
their PIs and head of administration, with copies
to our individual national members of the Global
Change Panel of the EU.
So far there is no formal decision on which
proposal to fund, this may happen in September
after negotiations with the selected proposals.
There is a seldom precedence in Europe that such
an intervention has been successful, but very
rarely.
In phrasing such a letter we have to be very
careful and make sure our message is clear and
fair, but I think it needs to be done.
I would therefore ask you to respond immediately
to this mail as to whether you think we should go
this route or not. We will then in a few days
send out a draft for comments, if you agree that
we shall send in a complaint. We have to move
fast here, so I hope you will be quick.
Concerning the other proposals on what to do,
there are many good ideas, and I think we should
have a meeting in the autumn to discuss the
strategy of securing paleo in the 7th Framwork
program. The text is out for review now, and we
all need to suggest changes through our national
representatives. I will distribute a list of who
this is for the various countries over the
week-end.
I am also working on formulating  text to help
launch our ideas in teh European Parliament via
Atte´s wife.
Best wishes,
Eystein",False,"This email appears to be a legitimate communication between members of a scientific community discussing a formal response to what they perceive as an unfair evaluation of their proposal compared to another. It does not exhibit the typical characteristics of a phishing attempt, such as inducing urgency, fear, desire, false authority, exploiting biases like recency, halo effect, or hyperbolic discounting, nor does it pique unwarranted curiosity with vague promises. The email is detailed and specific about the issue at hand, providing context about the review process and suggests a collective, reasoned response rather than demanding immediate personal action or information. There's no request for confidential information, no suspicious links provided for immediate action, and the overall tone is professional and focused on a group strategy rather than targeting individuals for deceptive purposes. The email focuses on a specific issue within a professional context, aiming to rally support for a formal complaint about an evaluation process, which aligns with normal practices in academic and professional settings."

%EM%JM@NETNOTEINC.COM%/EM%",False,"Analyzing the email based on the psychological traits and cognitive biases mentioned, the email does not strongly exhibit signs of a phishing attempt. Firstly, there's no evident sense of urgency compelling immediate action; the offer and rebate have set expiration dates, common in legitimate marketing. There's no inducing fear by threatening the recipient, as the email does not contain any threat or negative consequence for not acting. While the offer might seem enticing, it's within the realm of typical promotional deals rather than promising something excessively grandiose or too good to be true.

Regarding authority bias, the email mentions VoiceStream Wireless and SimplyWireless.com, which could be genuine companies, and without claims of improbable authority or expertise. The recency effect, halo effect, hyperbolic discounting, and curiosity effect do not seem to be manipulated significantly in this communication. The structure and content appear more aligned with standard marketing emails rather than phishing attempts. The email provides a clear option to unsubscribe, which is a common practice in legitimate marketing emails, although caution is always advised before clicking. Without overt signs of phishing tactics such as urgent threats, dubious links (aside from a potentially safe unsubscribe option), or requests for personal information, the conclusion leans towards this not being a phishing attempt. The main criteria would be to verify the authenticity of the entities mentioned through external means, but based on the provided information, it seems like a promotional email rather than a phishing scheme."

Delicious Chicken Recipes",False,"This email appears to be a promotional or informative message related to cooking, specifically involving the use of coconut milk in various recipes. There are no indications of the psychological traits and cognitive biases commonly exploited in phishing attempts, such as a sense of urgency, inducing fear by threatening, enticement with desire, authority bias, recency effect, halo effect, hyperbolic discounting, or curiosity effect. The language and tone used are informative and related to food, without pressing or threatening the reader or making overly enticing, authoritative, or vague promises. The email focuses on sharing recipes and cooking ideas from a presumably reputable source, Food & Wine magazine, without exploiting recent events, reputable brands, or authorities in a manner that would raise suspicion. The absence of requests for personal information, suspicious links (aside from a typical web view option), or characteristics of known phishing strategies in the email's context and presentation suggests that it is not a phishing attempt. Therefore, based on this analysis, the conclusion is that the email is not deceptive."

Knowledge base: IT help documentation",True,"This email attempts to exploit several psychological traits and cognitive biases, indicative of a phishing attempt. First, it creates a Sense of Urgency by stating that all email services will be interrupted and mentions a specific upgrade period, pressuring the recipient to act quickly to avoid service disruption. It also introduces a threat by threatening that the recipient's account will be deleted if not updated, exploiting the fear of losing access to their email account. The email purports to come from the Information Technology Services (ITS), a tactic that plays on Authority Bias, making the request seem more legitimate. However, the email asks for highly sensitive information, including the user's login ID, password, and phone number, which is a significant red flag. Legitimate IT services or organizations would not request such sensitive information via email. Additionally, the email contains odd references to a specific anti-virus version and encryption details, which seem intended to add a false sense of security and legitimacy but instead raise suspicion due to their specificity and the context of their request. The request to confirm these details by clicking a reply button and the generic, non-institution-specific contact information provided (e.g., a generic email address rather than an official institution domain) further indicate a phishing attempt. Combining these factors—the urgency, the threat, the appeal to authority, and the request for sensitive personal information—the email aligns well with common phishing tactics and patterns. Moreover, the time frame mentioned is outdated (January 1st to March 1st, 2014), which adds to the suspicion as it does not correlate with the current date. All these elements suggest that the email is likely a phishing attempt."
"Are We Crazy For Making This Complimentary?
Having trouble viewing this email? Click here
                                             #fblike",True,"The email exhibits several characteristics that align with common phishing tactics, leading to the conclusion that it is likely a phishing attempt. Firstly, the use of the word 'Complimentary' in the subject line entices with desire, aiming to attract the recipient's attention with the promise of something for free, which is a common phishing strategy to lure individuals into a scam. Moreover, the lack of specific information about what is being offered and why it's complimentary piques curiosity, another tactic phishers use to entice recipients into seeking more information, often leading them into risky situations such as clicking on malicious links. The inclusion of a clickable link with the text 'Click here if you're having trouble viewing this email' without any actual email content to view, exploits the Curiosity Effect and acts as a bait to encourage recipients to click on the link without offering any real value or context in the email itself. This vague promise and lack of detail are typical of phishing attempts designed to harvest personal data or infect devices with malware upon clicking such links. The presence of a seemingly unrelated social media prompt ('#fblike') at the end without any clear context or relevance to the email content further contributes to the suspicious nature of this email, suggesting an attempt to appear legitimate or engaging while lacking substantive content. Considering these factors, especially the enticement and exploitation of curiosity without providing clear, relevant information, the email aligns closely with typical phishing patterns and strategies."

XXVI General Assembly, Spring EGS Meeting
Comparison of Large-Scale Proxy-Based Temperature Reconstructions Over the
Past Few Centuries
MANN, M.E.; RUTHERFORD, S; OSBORN, T.J.
OA28.0  Study of past climates: Climate of the past millennium
JOUZEL, J.; (co-conveners: JONES, P.D.; MANN, M.E.)
Comparison of Large-Scale Proxy-Based Temperature Reconstructions Over the
Past Few Centuries
M.E. Mann(1), S. Rutherford(1), and T.J. Osborn(2)
(1) Univ. of Virginia, USA, (2) Climate Research Unit, Univ. East Anglia, UK
A  promising approach to the problem of reconstructing patterns of past
climate variability
involves the application of spatial climate field reconstruction (CFR)
techniques to networks of proxy
climate indicators (e.g., Mann et al 1998;2000--see

This approach seeks to exploit the complimentary information in a diverse
network of proxy indicators by determining the most consistent
relationships between these
networks of data and  the leading spatial patterns of climate variability
during a recent ""calibration"" period of overlap with the modern
instrumental record.
The calibrated relationship is then used to estimate large-scale patterns
of climate variability
in the past from the proxy data. This method makes no  assumptions regarding
the relationship between a given proxy indicator and specific local
annual/seasonal climate variable, but
does assume that the proxy indicator is tied to some combination of
large-scale patterns of climate variability.
Alternatively,  it is possible to  estimate large-scale temperature
patterns from a relatively homogenous network
of proxy climate indicators (e.g., tree-ring density data--see Briffa et
al, 1998) by invoking
a local calibration between each climate indicator and the climate variable
(e.g., summer temperature)
of interest. This approach is more conservative in the amount of
information it seeks to
extract from the proxy data network, but it is free from assumptions
regarding the large-scale
patterns of past climate variability. Recent reconstructions of Northern
Hemisphere annual-mean and
warm-season temperature patterns using these respective approaches and data
show some similarities,
but also some important differences. Here we investigate these differences
more closely, examining
the sensitivity of Northern Hemisphere temperature pattern reconstructions
to (a) the underlying
proxy data used, (b) the particular method used to estimate large-scale
patterns from these data,
and (c) the target  seasonality of the reconstruction. By controlling
independently for each of these
three factors, we gain insight into the reasons for differences between
various proxy-based estimates
of past large-scale temperature variability.

Firstly, there is no sense of urgency imposed on the recipients to take immediate action; the email is an informative abstract about climate studies and temperature reconstructions over the past few centuries, intended for professional or academic colleagues. Secondly, there is no attempt to induce fear, entice with unrealistic offers, or falsely claim authority in a manner that would suggest deceit; it merely presents an academic abstract shared among colleagues possibly for review or discussion. The language used is formal and pertinent to the subject matter without any pressing or threatening tone. There's no reference to recent events used exploitatively, no mention of reputable brands or celebrity endorsements, no offers of immediate rewards, and it does not invite curiosity through vague promises or intriguing attachments. The sender appears to be Professor Michael E. Mann, a credible source within the academic circle, further diminishing the likelihood of phishing. Instead, it embodies a typical scholarly communication, sharing research findings and inviting professional dialogue. There's also no request for personal information or actions that would compromise the recipient's security. Based on this comprehensive analysis, following the prescribed framework and considering the overall context and presentation of the email, it is concluded that this email is not a phishing attempt."
"NSM News Release:
German Government Hate's Free Speech, persecutes White Musicians & Activists:
I was just informed that one of the new German bands on the NSM Record Label had 4 of their recorded songs for their upcoming cd release on NSM Records, and their instruments seized by the German Government. The name of the band is Gojm, or Goyim in English (Goyim is a jewish word for Gentiles meaning Human Cattle).
What the German Zog does not know is that the 4 tracks they seized were the bonus tracks for the album, the other 8 songs, 39 minutes of music was already recorded and has already left Germany to be released here by NSM Records in the United States. The band has not been arrested, but as they put it, their songs and instruments were arrested.
We will release the forbidden/verboten cd with the 8 tracks that made it out of Germany, and if the other tracks are ever returned we may make them available on-line as free mp3's, or use them on a future release.
Here in the U.S. we still have the right to Freedom of speech, and musical freedom to play whatever kind of music we want. In Nations like Germany, a cd, questioning the Holohoax, a song, a Politically incorrect newspaper, or even a Salute can get you thrown in jail.
The German Government crackdown on musicians/bands such as musical greats like Landser, and countless other National Socialists activists, including the thousands of Political Prisoners in German jails rotting away for speaking words of truth and Patriotism, should light a fire under all of us to do even more in the Worldwide struggle for National Socialism.
I will end this NSM News Release with a message to the German Government: Your Tyranny against your own Citizens has not gone unnoticed by the International Community, nor the thousands of our Comrades you jail for thought and speech crimes. You are breeding a Revolution, a Revolution that is just about ready to snap and breakout into your streets, especially in the East. We National Socialists here in the U.S., and our International Allies will continue to do our part to support those you persecute.

It doesn't ask for personal information, urge immediate action, or contain external links designed to deceive the recipient into compromising personal data. Furthermore, this email seems to serve as a form of political or ideological communication, focusing on expressing viewpoints and information about the actions of the German government and NSM's stance rather than attempting to manipulate the recipient into providing personal information or clicking on malicious links.

A payment has been made to your account. To view the details of the payment, please
Login. to view details.
If you have any questions or would like more information, please contact our support centre",True,"This email exhibits several characteristics commonly associated with phishing attempts, notably the sense of curiosity and authority bias. By stating a payment has been made and urging the recipient to log in to view details, the email exploits the curiosity effect, making the recipient curious about the mentioned payment. This tactic is designed to entice recipients into clicking on potentially malicious links without providing clear details about the payment or the sender's identity, which is a red flag. Furthermore, the email leans on authority bias by impersonating a legitimate entity (implied through mentioning a support centre), which can induce a false sense of security and trust in the recipient. However, the lack of direct threats or urgency in the language does not strongly suggest the use of those specific biases or traits. Despite this, the combination of a vague enticing offer, the impersonation of an authority (implied through the support centre mention), and the absence of specific details about the sender or the payment itself, aligns with common phishing strategies aiming to manipulate the recipient into taking action — in this case, attempting to log in through a provided link which could be dangerous. Therefore, the conclusion that the email is likely a phishing attempt is based on the exploitation of curiosity and an impersonation of authority, alongside the general context that lacks transparency and details which are typical of legitimate communications."

Firstly, it creates a sense of urgency by claiming that access to sensitive account features has been limited and suggesting that this measure is for the user's protection, tapping into the psychological trait of inducing fear by threatening with potential loss of account access. Additionally, it exploits authority bias by impersonating a legitimate financial institution, the Credit Union, to appear credible and trustworthy. The demand for immediate action to 'restore' account access by completing a 'Steps to Remove Limitations' checklist further leverages the urge for hyperbolic discounting, encouraging the recipient to prefer the immediate reward of regained account access over the potential larger but delayed benefit of thoroughly verifying the email's legitimacy. The link provided for identity confirmation is highly suspicious, as legitimate banking institutions typically advise against clicking on links in emails for security reasons and instead recommend logging into accounts directly through their official websites. The combination of a created urgency, exploiting authority bias, and demanding immediate action, aligned with known phishing patterns and tactics, lead to the conclusion that the email is likely a phishing attempt."

PayPal Email ID PP522",True,"The email utilizes several psychological traits and cognitive biases commonly exploited in phishing attempts, which indicate its deceptive nature. Firstly, it creates a 'Sense of Urgency' by implying that the user's account has been subject to unusual activity and that action is required promptly to prevent limitations or closure of their account. The language used ('urgent', 'as soon as possible') presses the recipient to act quickly, likely without proper verification of the email's authenticity. Additionally, it leverages 'Authority Bias' by presenting itself as an official communication from PayPal's 'Account Review Department', thus exploiting the trust users place in communications from their financial institutions. The email also induces fear by threatening account limitations or closure, which can provoke recipients into hastily complying with the request to provide information. Furthermore, the demand to click on a link and enter 'specific information' aligns with common phishing strategies aiming to harvest personal and login details. The overall context, urging immediate action under the pretext of security and fraud prevention, and the inclusion of a direct link (a common vector for phishing attempts), strongly suggest it is a phishing attempt. The lack of personalization (e.g., addressing the recipient generically as 'PayPal user') and the request to click on an unsolicited link reinforce this conclusion. Based on these observations and the alignment with known phishing patterns and techniques, the email can be classified as likely phishing."

Malcolm,
Thanks for that, much appreciated.
I'll forward it on to Gil Compo and others linked to ACRE and
the AOPC WGs.  I think that Roger Stone from Queensland knows some of
your people, so there should be some good links all round.
I've also gone back to Howard Diamond, the US GCOS Rep, from
whom I'm hoping to get some financial support for such a meeting to
gauge his reaction to holding it in Europe.
Cheers,  Rob.

It does not exhibit typical phishing characteristics or exploit psychological traits often associated with deceptive attempts. Here's a breakdown based on the provided framework:

- There's no sense of urgency created to coerce the recipient into immediate action.
- No fear is induced by threatening negative outcomes.
- The content does not entice with unrealistic rewards or offers.
- The tone is professional and seems consistent with legitimate business communication, lacking an authoritative demand for action that is typical in phishing.
- References to recent events or exploiting the recency effect are absent; the discussion is focused on long-term scientific and corporate collaboration.
- There's no misuse of reputable brands or celebrity endorsements to gain trust falsely.
- Immediate rewards are not promised in exchange for quick action or personal information.
- Curiosity is not exploited by vague promises or intriguing attachments designed to lure the reader into a risky action.

Visit our Privacy Policy and User",True,"This email exhibits several characteristics typically associated with phishing attempts. Firstly, it entices the recipient with the promise of a large reward by announcing an unexpected lottery win linked to a highly credible event, the South Africa 2010 FIFA World Cup, exploiting the 'Enticement with Desire' principle. The urgency for the recipient to act is subtly instituted through the phrase 'Advise urgently,' aiming to expedite the contact without allowing the recipient ample time to scrutinize the email's authenticity, aligning with the 'Sense of Urgency' trait. The email attempts to leverage the 'Authority Bias' by affiliating itself with FIFA, a well-respected authority in the world of football, making the recipient more inclined to trust the communication. The request to contact a 'claims agent' through a provided telephone number and particularly an email address hosted on a common public domain ('hotmail.fr') rather than an official institutional or organizational email, typically indicates an attempt at deception. The email's vague nature and absence of detailed information about the recipient or the process to claim the prize aim to provoke curiosity, utilizing the 'Curiosity Effect' to motivate the recipient to initiate contact, potentially exposing them to risk. The combination of creating a scenario that demands urgent action, promising a highly desirable reward without any prior participation from the recipient (such as entering a lottery), presenting the message as originating from a figure of authority (FIFA), and directing communication to a non-official, non-secure channel, strongly suggests that this email is a phishing attempt. Moreover, the historical reference to the 'South Africa 2010 promotions' and sending of notification through an attached document could also exploit the 'Recency Effect,' despite the actual event being years ago. The overall presentation and content highly align with known phishing patterns and tactics."

Former critic plans 'Lobbyists for Trump' fundraiser
Washington Examiner - Gabby Morrongiello
A top Washington lobbyist who previously called Donald Trump ""a joke,"" now plans to host a fundraiser for the Republican presidential front-runner in early June.
Jack Burkman of J.M. Burkman and Associates will host government relations professionals and other lobbyists in the D.C. suburb of Arlington, Va. on June 10 as part of his ""Lobbyists for Trump"" effort.
According to an advisory released Monday, Burkman intends to raise $200 million over the next six months for the leading GOP candidate to use should he make it to the general election.
Burkman's effort to fundraise for the New York billionaire comes seven months after the D.C. lobbyist took out a full-page ad in the Los Angeles Daily News criticizing Trump and the other Republican presidential hopefuls at the time for not taking a firm stance against same-sex marriage.
""Donald Trump: You have no moral compass. You've been pro-choice, pro-life, pro-choice and now pro-life again,"" Burkman wrote in the ad.
He added, ""You'd believe anything that would get you elected. You're a joke.""

The language and tone used are informational rather than pressing, threatening, overly enticing, or authoritative. No immediate action is required from the recipient, nor are there promises of gain or solutions to a provoked fear.

©2006 EvergreenBank  & Co",True,"The analyzed email exhibits several characteristics indicative of a phishing attempt. Firstly, the email entices the recipient with the promise of a monetary reward (""$20 to your credit/debit card account"") for completing a task, which exploits the 'Enticement with Desire' psychological trait. This tactic can be compelling as it offers immediate gratification ('Hyperbolic Discounting') for what appears to be minimal effort on the part of the recipient. Additionally, the email employs the 'Curiosity Effect' by providing a vague 'quick and easy account update' description, prompting recipients to click on a link to learn more or complete the action, which potentially leads to a malicious website intended to harvest personal and financial information. The email also attempts to borrow credibility by associating itself with known entities, 'EQUAL HOUSING LENDER' and 'Member FDIC', along with a copyright claim to a bank & Co dated 2006 ('Halo Effect'). This inclusion of seemingly legitimate affiliations is designed to build trust and lower the recipient's guard by mimicking reputable institutions. However, the generic salutation ('Dear Customer') and the lack of specific personal or account details suggest a lack of authenticity typically associated with genuine communications from financial institutions. Given the combination of enticing with a monetary reward, vagueness aimed towards piquing curiosity, and the attempt to cloak the email in a veneer of legitimacy, it aligns well with common phishing strategies. The presence of these traits, particularly when synthesized together, strongly suggests that the email is a phishing attempt."

=",True,"Analyzing the content of the email reveals several indicators of phishing attempts based on the psychological traits and cognitive biases framework. Firstly, the email requests the recipient to 'complete the Regions InterAct Confirmation Form,' leveraging Authority Bias by mimicking Regions Bank's customer service. The imperative to complete a form suggests an attempt to harvest sensitive information under the guise of an authoritative directive, a common phishing tactic. Additionally, the email contains a hyperlink for the recipient to visit. The inclusion of a hyperlink intended for immediate action triggers a Sense of Urgency, pushing the recipient towards taking a hasty action that may compromise their security. Furthermore, the email's language, urging the recipient to act 'obligatory for all business and corporate clients,' further employs Authority Bias, mimicking official communication to gain compliance. The email's closing notes, emphasizing that it is an 'automated service' and discourages direct responses, might also exploit the Recency Effect, focusing recipients on the immediate request rather than encouraging them to verify the email's legitimacy through direct contact. Based on the presence of these traits - particularly the Authority Bias and Sense of Urgency, along with an attempt to isolate the recipient from direct communication channels for verification - the email follows common phishing strategies designed to deceive recipients into providing sensitive information or granting access to secure systems. Therefore, the conclusion is that the email is likely a phishing attempt."

Cambodia temple ruins yield treasure
Workers clearing dense jungle near the ruins of an ancient pagoda in
northern Cambodia have unearthed 31 Buddha statues - 27 of them solid gold.
The statues - which are 10 centimetres (4 inches) tall - are in good
condition and believed to be hundreds of years old.
They were found on Saturday as workers were rebuilding the Po Pich temple
about 100 km (65miles) north of the capital, Phnom Penh.
The pagoda, in the Batay district of Kampong Thom province, was torn down
during the reign of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s and the area became
overgrown.
Community care
Deputy police chief of Kampong Thom province, Hang Sithim, said the statues
- three of which were silver and one bronze - were buried in about one metre
(3.4ft) of earth and each weigh around 500 grams (1lb).
''I think that these Buddha statues had been buried hundreds of years ago,
when the last temple was fully operating,"" Mr Hang Sithim said.
Provincial authorities initially planned to take the statues to a nearby
town for safekeeping, but opted to allow the Buddhist community at the
temple to take care of them.
''We believe they are safe there,'' said Som Somphat, deputy governor of
Kampong Thom province.
''The people of Po Pich pledged to treat them with respect and honour.''
Reign of terror
A police guard has been placed around the site to protect it from looters.
The Khmer Rouge waged civil war in Cambodia between 1970 and 1998 and
controlled the country between 1975 and 1979.
The regime outlawed religion and destroyed many objects regarded as decadent
or culturally impure.
About two million people died in the Khmer Rouge's drive to turn Cambodia
into a farmers' utopia.

Firstly, it exploits the 'Sense of Urgency' by stating that if payment information is not updated within the next 3 days, the order will be canceled. This urgency could pressure the recipient into acting hastily without verifying the legitimacy of the email. Secondly, the 'Authority Bias' is exploited by posing as Amazon.com Customer Service, a trusted entity, to lend credibility to the request. The email includes a vague instruction to 'visit the following page' for updating payment information, but it fails to provide a specific URL, which is suspicious and a common tactic in phishing emails to get recipients to click on malicious links embedded in the text. Additionally, the vagueness serves to 'Pique Curiosity,' compelling the recipient to follow the link to find out more, potentially leading to a phishing website designed to harvest personal and financial information. The lack of specific details about the supposedly declined payment and the generic nature of the 'issue' (i.e., mismatched name, expiration date, or ZIP Code) further indicates an attempt to cast a wide net to catch as many victims as possible, rather than addressing a specific issue with a particular transaction. Lastly, the instruction not to reply to the email because the mailbox is not monitored is a common tactic used by phishers to avoid detection and prevent recipients from confirming the email's legitimacy directly with the purported sender. Considering these factors, especially the urgent language, the authoritative tone posing as an official Amazon communication, and the prompt to update payment information through an unspecified link, the email aligns closely with known phishing strategies.

First, it creates a sense of urgency by stating that the recipient's mailbox has exceeded storage limits, which could impede the ability to send or receive new emails. This urgency pressures the user to act quickly. Secondly, it employs a form of authority bias by impersonating a 'System Administrator,' a tactic designed to make the request seem more legitimate and urgent. Furthermore, the email asks the recipient to click on a link and submit their account details, a hallmark of phishing attempts where the goal is to steal personal information. The language and tone, while not overly aggressive, is crafted to provoke immediate action ('You may not be able to send or receive new mail until your mailbox size is reduced') without providing any verifiable contact details or alternative methods to confirm the message's authenticity. Lastly, there's an absence of detailed information or instructions on how to manually clear the mailbox without clicking the suspicious link, further pushing the user towards the phishing website. Given these factors, the email follows known phishing patterns such as creating urgency, asserting false authority, and soliciting personal information, leading to the conclusion that it is indeed a phishing attempt."
"As you are aware, there have recently been a number of virus attacks released and spread across the Internet. Although Enron continually readdresses and updates its virus protection procedures, new viruses will continue to be released and pose a threat to Enron's computing environment.

If you receive a file via Email or any other means and you are unfamiliar with the sender or the purpose of the file, please do not automatically open/launch the file. One of the key elements of a virus attack is the innocent nature of its delivery.
Viruses can cause a significant amount of damage, including data loss and service outage. Viruses such as the Melissa, ILOVEYOU, AnnaKournikova, and the recent Nimda virus, caused organizations billions of dollars.

Prevention & Detection = PROTECTION!",False,"The email does not exhibit typical phishing traits or exploit cognitive biases that are usually associated with phishing attempts. Firstly, there is no induced sense of urgency that pressures the recipient into making decisions quickly. The tone is informative rather than pressing or threatening. Secondly, there is no threat that induces fear; instead, the email educates about potential risks and encourages cautious behavior. Thirdly, there are no enticing offers that seem too good to be true, no false claims of authority or expertise beyond the legitimate concern for virus protection within a company's IT environment, and no exploitation of recent events to make the message seem more urgent or relevant. Additionally, there is no implication of a reputable brand or celebrity endorsement to gain trust unduly, no offers for immediate rewards, and the email does not pique curiosity with vague promises or intriguing attachments. The language used is educational and aimed at preventing virus attacks by encouraging responsible behavior, aligning with standard internal communication about IT security rather than phishing schemes. The context of ensuring a virus-free computing environment within Enron is legitimate, and the contact information provided for various resolution centers adds to the authenticity of the message. Based on these observations, the email aligns more closely with typical internal communications regarding IT security practices rather than phishing strategies."

Remove here:",True,"This email exhibits several psychological traits and cognitive biases indicative of a phishing attempt. Firstly, the use of provocative and sexually explicit language aims to entice readers through desire, by creating a scenario some might find appealing or curiosity-provoking. This connects to the Curiosity Effect, as the email piques interest with the promise of explicit content, enticing the reader to 'follow the link below.' The language is also quite pressing and uses shock value to grab attention, which could lead to impulsive actions, such as clicking the link without considering the consequences. The email lacks professionalism and context, which is atypical for legitimate communication, and it does not mention anything time-sensitive that could indicate urgency, but the bold and scandalous content itself is designed to encourage quick action to satisfy curiosity or desire. Plus, legitimate businesses or organizations do not typically promote content in such an unprofessional manner, nor do they solicit through emails with such content. The absence of a legitimate reason for the email (such as a clear, professional offer, event, or service) further indicates its deceptive nature. Hence, considering the overall context, presentation, and the tactics used in the email, it aligns with common phishing strategies aiming to exploit psychological biases for malicious purposes."

Firstly, it exhibits 'Enticement with Desire' by offering free standard shipping, savings on gas, and chances to win a VIP Vegas Vacation or $600 cash, which seem too good to be true. These offers exploit recipients' desires for rewards and savings, pressuring them to act impulsively without verifying the email's authenticity. Secondly, there's an attempt at 'Curiosity Effect' through the vague yet appealing offers, such as the VIP vacation and cash prize, which could lure recipients into clicking the provided links out of curiosity. Thirdly, the 'Authority Bias' might be subtly leveraged by masquerading as well-known entities like CBS SportsLine.com and MVP.com, making the email appear more legitimate and trustworthy. The combination of these tactics, especially the unsolicited offers and the pressure to click on links without providing concrete details or verifiable sources, aligns closely with common phishing strategies. The email lacks personalization and detailed information about the sender or the legitimacy of the offers, further raising suspicion.

"Trump aides huddle with RNC to plot big-money strategy
The presumptive nominee seeks to exert control over the Republican Party.
By KENNETH P. VOGEL, ELI STOKOLS and ALEX ISENSTADT
05/09/16 05:26 PM EDT
Updated 05/09/16 06:17 PM EDT
Donald Trump's campaign is hashing out the details of an agreement with Republican Party leaders that could allow the presumptive GOP presidential nominee to raise six-figure checks for his presidential campaign, multiple sources with direct knowledge of the negotiations tell POLITICO.
The fundraising agreement was among the subjects discussed at a Monday meeting at the Republican National Committee's Washington offices between top RNC officials, including chairman Reince Priebus, and senior Trump aides, including campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, senior adviser Paul Manafort and political director Rick Wiley, according to the sources.
The talks represent the first formal steps towards a merger between the official apparatus of the Republican Party and a candidate who many party leaders scorned until recently, and about whom there remains deep leeriness in some Republican quarters.
Since Trump essentially clinched the GOP nomination with a win in last week's Indiana primary, his staff have moved quickly to put their stamp on the party's general election planning process. Wiley has paid several visits to the party's headquarters on Capitol Hill to assess its efforts, according to the sources. The campaign also has been discussing convention-related issues with the RNC, including credentials and rules, the sources said, adding that the campaign is expected in the coming days to formally deputize a staffer as a liaison to the national party committee.
And deputy campaign manager Michael Glassner this week is set to lead a delegation to the convention site, Cleveland's Quicken Loans Arena, to receive a briefing from RNC officials involved in planning for the July event, as POLITICO first reported
last week.
Fundraising was not a major focus of Monday's meetings, according to RNC senior strategist Sean Spicer. ""It was 3 ½ hours on briefings from all the RNC divisions regarding the capabilities and resources that we have been compiling to win in November,"" said Spicer, who attended the meeting, and said it included presentations on the party's ground game, and its data, communications and research efforts.
The conversations are also partly an effort to lay the groundwork for a Thursday meeting in Washington between Trump, Priebus and House Speaker Paul Ryan, who announced last Thursday that he is withholding his endorsement until Trump outlines a stronger commitment to conservative principles.
The perception among Trump's inner circle is that Ryan is attempting to leverage his position as chairman of the Cleveland convention into securing a deal that protects the party's control over vendor contracts and how the money raised jointly by the party and Trump's campaign is spent.
""Trump is a tough negotiator, understands the history of what he's entitled to here,"" another Trump confidant said. ""They want the RNC to be autonomous but they'll work with the Trump campaign. They need Trump to help raise the money but they want their vendors to be the ones to spend the money.""
But Trump may be more reliant on the national party than past presidential nominees, since his campaign has invested relatively little in field staff, voter data or a fundraising operation.
Some of Trump's infrastructure deficiencies can be traced to his unwillingness to dig deep into his own fortune to finance his campaign, which he has pledged from the beginning to self-finance.
Entering into a joint fundraising agreement and leaning on the party for cash and staff would help fill that void in an election expected to cost each side more than $1 billion. But it also could undermine his rhetoric about being independent from the party's donor class.
Trump has already agreed to appear next week at a $25,000 per-plate fundraiser to benefit the New Jersey Republican Party, just days after the New York billionaire tapped Gov. Chris Christie to run his presidential transition.
The May 19 event is being billed as a ""roundtable"" with Christie and Trump, and will be held at the Lawrenceville National Guard Armory, according to an invitation obtained by POLITICO. Just 12 people will be permitted to attend the roundtable, according to a note sent with the invitation.
The RNC has been taking the lead in reaching out to state parties to put together the joint fundraising arrangement with Trump's campaign, and its plans are actually further along than they were at this point four years ago, said one source familiar with the negotiations.
""I know (the Trump campaign staff) have been impressed with what the RNC already has on the ground,"" said the source. ""Four years ago, when Romney walked into the building, the RNC didn't have anywhere close to the field staff that it has now. ... There is a big difference.""
Yet efforts to finalize the agreement also could test the willingness of state GOP officials to get behind a presumptive nominee who some official openly opposed during the contentious primary.
Colorado's state party appeared to gloat last month after Trump's vanquished rival Ted Cruz swept all 34 delegate slots at the state's caucus. ""We did it. #NeverTrump,"" the state party tweeted, only to delete and disavow
the post minutes later.
Party spokesman Kyle Kohli on Monday said the Colorado GOP hasn't had any talks with Trump or the RNC about a joint fundraising agreement.
The South Carolina Republican Party is open to participating but hasn't engaged in any talks yet, said the chairman, Matt Moore.
The more state parties that participate, the more money a Trump joint fundraising committee can accept, thanks in part to a 2014 Supreme Court case called McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission
. It struck down aggregate limits on total giving to federal campaigns, allowing maximum donations to as many different committees as a donor wanted.
Trump's likely general election opponent, Hillary Clinton, created an unprecedented joint fundraising committee
with the Democratic National Committee and 32 state party committees that can accept checks as large as $356,100 this year.
Early in the election cycle, the talk among GOP state party officials was of a joint fundraising committee that could include all 50 states and six territories, allowing maximum donations of about $1 million per person, according to one state party chairman. But those talks quieted as Trump's surprising rise threw the GOP primary into chaos, said the chairman.
Sources with knowledge of the RNC's current plans said its joint fundraising arrangement would include between four and 12 state committees, which could allow the committee to accept checks ranging from $78,800 and $158,000.
The joint committee could help Trump's campaign as well as the RNC, which has struggled to keep its finances intact. The committee ended March with just $16 million on hand and nearly $2 million in outstanding debt. Taken together, the bank account is a fraction of where the committee had been at similar points in 2008 and 2012.
Many Republican state party chairs, who depend on the RNC to fund a get-out-the-vote program, are anxious to see Trump and the committee form an agreement.
""We are a battleground state and we can expect a lot of money to support our push,"" said Rob Gleason, the Pennsylvania GOP chair. ""We already were getting a lot of money from the RNC, but we need a lot more.""
""Trump should be able to get us up to speed,"" he added.",False,"The text appears to be a legitimate news article from POLITICO, discussing the collaboration between Donald Trump's campaign team and the Republican National Committee (RNC) to strategize on fundraising. It does not exhibit the typical characteristics of a phishing attempt. There is no sense of urgency or fear-inducing threats that require the reader to act immediately. The language used is informative and neutral rather than pressing or threatening. Moreover, it does not entice with too-good-to-be-true offers or claim false authority. Although it mentions financial dealings, the context is a political strategy discussion rather than soliciting direct contributions from the reader. The email does not exploit recent events unfairly, lean on reputable brands, or offer immediate rewards to provoke hyperbolic discounting. Lastly, it does not pique curiosity through vague promises or intrigue. Instead, it provides detailed information on the ongoing discussions between Trump's campaign and the RNC, reflecting typical political reporting rather than a phishing scheme."

Equal Housing Lender, All Rights Reserved",True,"The email exhibits several traits and biases that are consistent with phishing attempts. Firstly, it employs 'Enticement with Desire' by promising a reward of $50 to participants' Mastercard/Visa card account, which can be considered too good to be true. The lure of easy money for a simple task is a common phishing strategy aimed at enticing recipients. Secondly, the email also invokes the 'Authority Bias' by presenting itself as originating from a reputable banking institution, 'Fifth Third Bank.' This is designed to exploit trust in the brand, convincing recipients of the email's legitimacy. Additionally, the promise of anonymity and assurance that information will not be shared with third parties could be seen as a tactic to allay fears and encourage participation, subtly playing into the 'Curiosity Effect' by implying that the survey is both exclusive and safe. However, the email lacks specific urgency, fear-inducing threats, or direct reference to recent events that would trigger the 'Recency Effect.' Despite this, the combination of enticing offers, misuse of authority, and implications of exclusivity and safety, particularly the request to click on a link (which is a common phishing red flag), suggests a phishing attempt. The lack of detailed contact information and the promise of financial compensation for such a minimal task further raises suspicions. Taken together, these characteristics are indicative of a phishing email, designed to harvest personal data or financial information under the guise of a legitimate survey."

Firstly, it plays on the enticement with desire by presenting an appealing offer to 'repair your bad credit' which is a common concern many individuals have, making the proposition highly enticing. The promise of an easy solution to a complex problem ('ONLINE CREDIT REPAIR!!!') coupled with the assertion of being '100% effective' targets those in desperate situations, potentially clouding their judgment and making them more susceptible to the offer. Secondly, the email utilizes the curiosity effect by inviting the recipient to click on a link for 'FREE information,' with little to no detail about what the process involves or the company behind it. This tactic aims to exploit human curiosity, encouraging recipients to click through without considering the risks. Additionally, the mention that the recipient's email address was obtained from a 'purchased list' raises further suspicion, as it suggests a lack of previous engagement or relationship, which is common in phishing attempts to cast a wide net by sending unsolicited emails en masse. The combination of promising an unrealistically simple and effective solution to a common problem, the encouragement to take immediate action by clicking on a link, and the vague sourcing of the recipient's email address align closely with known phishing strategies. Therefore, the conclusion is that this email is likely a phishing attempt, designed to entice recipients into clicking through to a potentially malicious site or to deceive them into providing personal information under the guise of credit repair."

Mike, Ray, Caspar,
A couple of things - don't pass on either.
1. Have seen you're RC bet. Not entirely sure this is the right way to go,
but it will drum up some discussion.
Anyway Mike and Caspar have seen me present possible problems with the
SST data (in the 1940s/50s and since about 2000). The first of these will appear
in Nature on May 29. There should be a News and Views item with this article
by Dick Reynolds. The paper concludes by pointing out that SSTs now (or since
about 2000, when the effect gets larger) are likely too low. This likely won't
get corrected quickly as it really needs more overlap to increase confidence.
Bottom line for me is that it appears SSTs now are about 0.1 deg C too cool
globally. Issue is that the preponderance of drifters now (which measure SST
better but between 0.1 and 0.2 lower than ships) mean anomalies are low
relative to the ship-based 1961-90 base.
This also means that the SST base the German modellers used in their runs
was likely too warm by a similar amount. This applies to all modellers, reanalyses etc.
There will be a lot of discussion of the global T series with people saying we can't
even measure it properly now.
The 1940s/50s problem with SSTs (the May 29 paper) also means there will be
warmer SSTs for about 10 years. This will move the post-40s cooling to a little
later - more in line with higher sulphate aerosol loading in the late 50s and 1960s70s.
The paper doesn't provide a correction. This will come, but will include the addition
of loads more British SSTs for WW2, which may very slightly cool the WW2 years.
More British SST data have also been digitized for the late 1940s. Budget
constraints mean that only about half the RN log books have been digitized. Emphasis
has been given to the South Atlantic and Indian Ocean log books.
As an aside, it is unfortunate that there are few in the Pacific. They have digitized
all the logbooks of the ships journeys from the Indian Ocean south of Australia and NZ
to Seattle for refits. Nice bit of history here - it turns out that most of the ships
are
US ones the UK got under the Churchill/Roosevelt deal in early 1940. All the RN bases
in South Africa, India and Australia didn't have parts for these ships for a few years.
So the German group would be stupid to take your bet.  There is a likely
ongoing negative volcanic event in the offing!
2. You can delete this attachment if you want. Keep this quiet also, but
this is the person who is putting in FOI requests for all emails Keith and Tim
have written and received re Ch 6 of AR4. We think we've found a way
around this.
I can't wait for the Wengen review to come out with the Appendix showing what
that 1990 IPCC Figure was really based on.
The Garnaut review appears to be an Australian version of the Stern Report.

There are no offers or promises made, no exploitation of current events, and most importantly, no requests for sensitive information or actions that could pose a security risk. The context of discussing a mundane matter such as 'dropping off sulfur' and mentioning a personal meeting does not align with common phishing strategies, which typically involve soliciting personal, financial, or login information under false pretenses. Given the absence of phishing characteristics and the nature of the communication, it's concluded that this email is not a phishing attempt."

Subject: ICYMI: Donald Trump and the Art of the Tax Loophole
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Donald Trump and the Art of the Tax Loophole
The New York Times
By Steven Rattner
May 13, 2016

​-​
stops/donald-trump-and-the-art-of-the-tax-loophole.html
TYPE “Trump system rigged” into the Google search bar and you’ll get more than 500,000 hits. I didn’t inspect all of them but the first 50 were variants of Donald Trump complaining that the Republican primary process was tilted against him.
That’s beyond ironic. Mr. Trump and his family have been the beneficiaries of a great rigged system: the tax code, which bestows huge advantages on the real estate business. Throughout his career, Mr. Trump has not only grabbed for every loophole and legal lever he could find, he’s boasted about it.
“I’ve taken advantage of the laws of this country, like other people,” Mr. Trump has said.
The Republican front-runner has been dodging releasing his returns on the specious grounds that he was being audited. On Tuesday, he told The Associated Press that he wouldn’t release them before the election — period. On Wednesday, he denied saying this, reversed course and said,“Hopefully before the election I’ll release.”
“There’s nothing to learn from them,” he said in the Associated Press interview.
I’ll bet there’s plenty to learn. More likely, Mr. Trump doesn’t want us to know how small his tax hit is, something that he bragged about earlier in the campaign, before realizing that it could come back to bite him.
“I fight like hell to pay as little as possible,” Mr. Trump said last August.
Real estate guys can take advantage of the best loopholes left in the tax code, thanks in part to some aggressive nudging of lawmakers. For starters, real estate investors can take deductions for the ostensible depreciation of the value of their buildings, even though the point of owning buildings is that they generally appreciate.
For another, they often borrow against those properties, and because they hold these investments in partnerships or limited liability companies, the interest payments are tax-deductible.
“If you get close to paying taxes, you just buy another building,” a real estate friend told me.
If Mr. Trump were to sell a property, the profits would be taxed as capital gains at far lower rates (23.8 percent) than those imposed on ordinary income (39.6 percent). But real estate owners often don’t even pay capital gains taxes. They can take advantage of a provision known as Section 1031 to swap a piece of real estate that they are ready to part with for one that they would like to add to their portfolio — all tax free. There is no limit on how many swaps they can make, deferring capital gains taxes indefinitely.
Section 1031 is among the real estate operators’ favorite provisions — and it’s a break not readily available to other kinds of investors. No wonder that attempts to rein in or eliminate Section 1031, including a recent one by the Obama administration, have been met with fierce resistance from the industry.
The tax benefits don’t stop, even at death. If an investor dies holding appreciated properties, the heirs get a step up in basis, which means that they can sell the real estate and pay no taxes on the gain in value.
Mr. Trump’s quest for loopholes ranges far. In 2005, he got a $39.1 million tax deduction for donating a conservation easement on a New Jersey golf course, meaning that any further development on the property is restricted. On top of that, he installed goats on two of his New Jersey golf courses as part of a plan to get them designated as agricultural properties, thereby vastly lowering his property taxes.
Meanwhile, according to Mr. Trump’s campaign, from 2010 to 2014, he “donated” more than $102 million to charity — without giving away even $1 of his own money. More conservation easements constituted the biggest source of deductions, but the “gifts” included items like free rounds of golf for charity events. Many of these “charitable contributions,” of course, gave rise to more tax deductions.
Taxes are far from the only way that Mr. Trump has gamed the system. He’s added materially to his net worth by pushing the edges of the bankruptcy laws.
By arguing that his name had huge commercial value, for example, he managed to retain more ownership in his Atlantic City hotel and casino projects than is customary in an insolvency, thereby minimizing his losses while his creditors lost billions.
Finally, by his own admission, Mr. Trump has used our broken campaign finance system to achieve private gain by giving generously to politicians of both parties (including to Hillary Clinton) in order to gain influence. Since 1989, he has donated more than $1.5 million to political causes, 62 percent of it going to Republicans, according to PolitiFact.
“When they call, I give,” Mr. Trump said in the first Republican debate. “And you know what? When I need something from them, two years later, three years later, I call them. They are there for me.”
Among the ways that politicians have been there for him and his brethren has been developing a tax system in which real estate moguls pay little or no taxes. “The Declaration of Independence tells us that all men are created equal, but the government definitely favors real estate investors!” wrote one such investor, David Lindahl. Where did this appear? “Trump University Commercial Real Estate Investing 101.”

Thank you,
USAA.",True,"The email employs several traits indicative of a phishing attempt. First, it creates a sense of urgency by stating that the recipient's access to USAA Online Services has been limited, suggesting an immediate need to act. This urgency is a common tactic used to prevent the recipient from taking the time to critically evaluate the legitimacy of the email. Second, it uses the Authority Bias by posing as USAA, a reputable financial services group, to elicit trust and compliance from the recipient. The call to 'Update Now' with no specific details on how or why the account needs to be updated is vague, pushing the recipient towards a hasty decision likely involving the disclosure of personal information on a phishing site designed to mimic USAA's official page. The lack of detailed information, the generic greeting 'Dear Customer,' and the immediate call to action without verification through official channels (e.g., customer service phone number or secure account message) further suggest a phishing attempt. Thus, considering the induced urgency, exploitation of authority, and the overall context lacking specific user information or secure confirmation methods, the email aligns with common phishing strategies, leading to the conclusion that it is indeed deceptive."

Firstly, a sense of urgency is created with the imminent offline system maintenance, suggesting users won't have access to their email and other services. This is a common tactic designed to rush the recipient into taking action without proper scrutiny. The demand to 'Activate by completing the Microsoft outlook web access page' and the embedded 'Click Here' link are classic phishing elements, aiming to entice the user into providing sensitive information on a potentially fraudulent webpage. The email falsely claims authority by signing off as 'System Administrator' and including a comprehensive disclaimer intended to mimic legitimate corporate communication, thus exploiting the authority bias. The implementation of these phishing characteristics is cunningly designed to exploit psychological traits and cognitive biases, such as urgency and authority bias, to trick the recipient into clicking on the fraudulent link. There is no personalized greeting, which is unusual for genuine organizational communications that would typically address the recipient directly, especially in the context of mandatory system maintenance. The overall presentation aligns closely with known phishing patterns, including the exploitation of a recipient's fear of losing access to critical services and the desire to remedy the situation swiftly. Considering these analyzed traits and the context in which they are presented, the email is highly likely to be a phishing attempt designed to harvest personal information or login credentials."

ITS HELP DESK,
© Copyright 2013.",True,"This email exhibits several characteristics that align with common phishing strategies, making it highly likely to be a phishing attempt. Firstly, it creates a 'Sense of Urgency' by claiming the recipient's email account will be blocked within 24 hours, pressuring the recipient to act hastily. This is a tactic to prevent the recipient from taking the time to scrutinize the email's legitimacy. Secondly, the email contains elements of 'Inducing Fear by Threatening' negative consequences - in this case, the inability to send or receive mail and account deactivation if the recipient fails to verify their email account through the provided link. Furthermore, the use of authoritative language, purporting to be from 'ITS HELP DESK,' exploits the 'Authority Bias,' making the recipient more likely to trust the message. The language used ('You are advised to verify your email account') is pressing and gives an illusion of official communication, further implemented to coerce the recipient into following the instructions. Moreover, the offer to 'avoid this problem' by verifying through a suspicious link aligns with tactics that entice with a false solution to a provoked fear. The email also fails to mention any specific details about the recipient, which is common in phishing attempts where messages are broadly distributed in hopes that some recipients will be deceived. Lastly, the copyright date of '2013' seems outdated and might indicate the lack of attention to detail typical of phishing attempts. Considering these identified characteristics and their implementation within the email, it follows known phishing patterns closely, leading to the conclusion it is indeed a phishing attempt."
"Talking about Ted Cruz, and about how to make GOP convention more exciting
Please Save from yesterday: 
Donald Trump called on Ted Cruz on Monday to quit the presidential race and go back to the U.S. Senate if Tuesday's Indiana primary ends with the billlionaire beating the senator.
'Yes, he should. He should leave the race if I win,' Trump told DailyMail.com in a wide-ranging interview at an Indianapolis hotel during his last day of campaigning in the Hoosier State.
'Now, let's see what happens. Indiana's a great state and I have the support of Bobby Knight and so many other people. We'll have to see what happens, but yes, I think he should get out of the race,' Trump said.
The Republican front-runner also said Cruz's 'tough temperament' might make him unsuitable for a spot on his short-list of potential Supreme Court nominees – a consolation prize he could offer the Texas as a party-unifying gesture.
Instead, Trump insisted Ted prepare to pack his bags – and doubled down on his demand later during a lunchtime stop at Shapiro's Delicatessen a few blocks from Lucas Oil Stadium.
Asked during an impromptu press gaggle whether an Indiana defeat should spell the end of a Cruz candidacy, he told reporters: 'I think it should.'
A Cruz spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Monday morning's interview touched on Trump's foreign policy goals, his attitude toward the media, his criticism of past Republican National Conventions, and whether a President Trump would deliver a comedy routine at the White House Correspondents Association's annual gala.
Indiana's 57 delegates to the Republican National Convention, should Trump claim them in Tuesday's winner-take-all primary election, would put the businessman within striking distance of the magic number – 1,237 – that he needs in order to become the party's White House nominee.
Cruz has insisted that he will stay in the contest all the way to the July convention in Cleveland, Ohio.
he launched an ad Monday in Indiana in which he tries to turn Trump's nickname for him – 'Lyin' Ted' – back on the real estate tycoon.
The ad, titled 'Lying,' features an announcer claiming that 'Donald Trump is lying about Ted Cruz' with respect to the senator's positions on trade, illegal immigration and work visas.
'Trump also had a one-million-dollar judgment against him for hiring illegals,' the ad claims.
'What a phony.'
But Indianans seem to be siding with Trump, giving him a 15-point edge in an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released yesterday.
Trump lashed out at Cruz Monday morning, telling DailyMail.com that he disagrees with the Texan's characterization of him earlier in the day as a hateful bully and his base as 'bitter, angry, petty, bigoted people.'
'That is not America. I reject that vision of America,' Cruz told reporters in Indiana after a campaign stop.
'They're not angry,' Trump said of his loyal following. 'They're very disappointed in politicians like him that get a lot of money from special interest groups, and they protect their special interest groups very much to the detriment of the country.'
Trump has faced calls for specifics about how he will 'unify' the Republican Party if he performs well enough in the remaining ten primary elections to claim the GOP's nomination outright.
But the billionaire said he isn't ready to put Cruz on the Supreme Court as a consolation prize – because his 'temperament' might not be suited to the job.
Cruz, once the solicitor general for the Lone Star State, argued nine cases before America's highest court, winning five of them.
'I don't know. I'd have to think about it. That's a big decision,' he told DailyMail.com, saying that he's aware of Cruz's record as a constitutional lawyer.
'But there's a whole question of uniting, and there's a whole question as to temperament. And I'd have to think about it.'
Trump raised Cruz's 'temperament' four separate times while explaining why putting the lawmaker on his Supreme Court short-list wasn't an easy call.
He has said in the past that in order to quell conservatives' concerns about how he would approach Supreme Court appointments, he would release a list of names during the campaign and pledge to to only choose nominees from it.
'He's got a tough temperament for what we're talking about,' Trump said of Cruz. 'You have to be a very, very smart, rational person in my opinion, to be a justice of any kind at a high level or low.'
'You need a proper temperament. And that would be a question that I would have.'
At Shapiro's, Trump projected confidence as the lunch crowd milled around him and asked for autographs and selfies. He signed one man's $50 bill before dining at a table that included campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and nonfiction author Ed Klein.
Asked whether the general election season begins for him on Wednesday, he said: 'Yes, I mean it's sort of already started.'
Citing a new national poll, he added: 'Rasmussen just came out and I'm three points up on Hillary ... and I haven't even started yet.'",False,"The provided content does not exhibit common characteristics of a phishing email. It is a detailed account of political statements and interactions, specifically focusing on Donald Trump's perspective on Ted Cruz's participation in the presidential race and the potential aftermath of the Indiana primary election. The text does not create a sense of urgency, induce fear, offer something too good to be true, falsely claim authority, exploit recent events for immediacy, imply endorsements from reputable brands or celebrities, offer immediate rewards, or pique curiosity with vague promises. Instead, it reads as a political news report, lacking the immediate call to action, deceptive enticements, or manipulative language typically found in phishing attempts. There is no request for personal information, financial details, or actions that would put the reader at risk.

9800 Fredericksburg Road, San Antonio, TX 78288-9876",True,"The email displays several classic characteristics that suggest it's a phishing attempt. Firstly, it exploits the psychological trait of creating a 'Sense of Urgency' by stating that the recipient must sign in to their account within 48 hours to update and confirm their personal information to avoid account restriction. This pressure tactic is designed to make the recipient act hastily without proper scrutiny. Secondly, it employs the tactic of 'Authority Bias' by impersonating USAA, a reputable financial institution, to appear credible and trustworthy, encouraging the recipient to comply with the request. The language used ('To protect you and your financial information') also attempts to induce fear, subtly suggesting that the user's financial information is currently at risk, which capitalizes on the 'Inducing Fear by Threatening' psychological trait. Moreover, the email lacks specific personalization ('Dear Customer'), which is common in phishing emails that are sent out in mass, rather than targeting individuals specifically. The presence of a 'Sign On' button rather than directing users to visit the official site by typing the URL into their browser is a common phishing technique for harvesting credentials. The combination of these factors—urgency, impersonation of authority, lack of specific personalization, and a direct link for action—is indicative of phishing attempts aimed at stealing personal information. Additionally, legitimate organizations would typically provide more direct means of contact and information verification without urging immediate action through a single email. Based on these observations, the email is likely a phishing attempt."
"I need everyone to send on this time!
TeenScreen is really on the run. If we get our message
to enough people right now, we'll win this game.
TeenScreen will completely disappear and the youth of
America can grow up safely without TeenScreen's
intervention and drugs.
In the last week, there was an article on raising
money for suicide programs in the Vallejo (California)
Times-Herald. Then on Friday they published a letter
to the editor from TeenScreen's director, full of
lies, and with the total intention to gain support for
their suppressive cause.
We need to overwhelm this paper with true data.
Do you know why TeenScreen has been able to get so
far? Because there is a vacuum of information on
suicide. If TeenScreen is the only one popping up and
saying 'here's a solution', they'll win.
The assignment:
1. Read Leslie MacGuire's letter at this link or the
text at the bottom of this message:

2. Rip her to shreds.
Write a letter to the editor and send it to
opinion@timesheraldonline.com
You can write what you want but I have a suggestion.
-If your last name begins with A-C, L-M, or S-Z, I
want you to state that you are writing in response to
MacGuire's letter. You can say almost anything and you
don't have to be nice. I suggest that you point out
that her letter is just advertising, not public
opinion, that suicide screening has never been shown
to reduce suicide, that TeenScreen just leads to more
drugging with drugs known to cause suicide, and that
the use of TeenScreen takes money and effort away from
programs that actually are proven to work! - like
volunteer suicide hotlines, improving education, drug
abuse prevention programs, religious programs. Hell,
you can throw in ""Set a Good Example"" contest and ""The
Way to Happiness"" if you feel like. It will make them
look it up.
-If your last name begins with the other letters, I
suggest that you ignore Leslie and write a letter to
the editor in response to the original article. I
can't deliver you a copy of that article because it's
fee-based. I'm sure it says something about raising
money to prevent suicide and that's all you really
need to know. Your letter mention things like the fact
that mental health screening is bad and just leads to
more psych drug use, that our leaders should find the
true and workable solutions and not just accept any
program that is offered. Also you could bring out the
fact that
suicide is VERY rare, not an epidemic, that there are
other more serious problems like illiteracy and drug
abuse.
3. And report compliance by email.
Thank you!
Doyle
______________________________
LETTER TEXT:
A critical issue
Thank you for your article regarding the recent walk
to raise money for suicide prevention programs
(""Shining a light in the darkness of suicide,"" May
22). Coverage on this important topic helps to shed
light on the critical issue of suicide, a very real
and prevalent problem that is too often overlooked.
In California, suicide is the third leading cause of
death for 15- to
19-year-olds. Studies by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) show that 17 percent of
American high school students think seriously about
suicide and 9 percent have made a suicide attempt.
Research tells us that 90 percent of youth who die by
suicide suffer from a diagnosable and treatable mental
illness at the time of their death, but the vast
majority of these teens are not known to their
parents, teachers or other adults as suffering from a
mental disorder.
In response to this public health crisis, Columbia
University has spent more than a decade developing,
implementing, and evaluating its TeenScreen Program.
TeenScreen is a voluntary mental health screening
program that provides communities throughout the
nation with free tools and training to identify youth
who are at risk for suicide and those suffering from
unidentified mental illness. Screening is always
voluntary and no child is screened without a parent's
permission.
Mental illness and suicide are public health issues
which should be public concerns. I applaud your
community for taking interest in this critical issue,
and strongly encourage parents, health professionals,
educators and others in your community to prioritize
early intervention and prevention initiatives
including mental health screening to help prevent
unnecessary suffering and the tragedy of suicide.
Leslie McGuire, Director, Columbia University
TeenScreen Program

Do You Yahoo!?
Tired of spam?  Yahoo! Mail has the best spam protection around",True,"The email demonstrates several characteristics identifiable with phishing or scam attempts, though its nature is somewhat unique as it aims to mobilize readers against a specific target rather than directly soliciting financial information or spreading malware. Firstly, it exploits the Authority Bias by positioning the sender as a leader directing a campaign against the TeenScreen program, suggesting that the sender's authority should compel action. Additionally, there is a clear use of Urgency created in the message, urging recipients to act quickly to combat the TeenScreen initiative, implying that immediate action is necessary to prevent further progress of the program they are opposing. The language used induces Fear by suggesting that without the recipients' immediate action, the youth of America will be negatively impacted by TeenScreen's interventions. Despite its uncommon target, the structure and psychological manipulation techniques align with those leveraged in phishing emails. The primary aim here appears to be mobilization based on misinformation and fear, rather than financial gain or data theft directly. However, it shares enough characteristics with deceptive emails, such as attempting to illicit quick action based on emotional manipulation, to be considered as utilizing phishing-like tactics. The specifics of this email also suggest a concerted effort to undermine a public health initiative, which is deceptive and harmful in nature."

Secondly, there's an authoritative tone, claiming to be from BancorpSouth, which plays on the 'Authority Bias' by leveraging the trust in the financial institution's name to lend credibility to the demand. Additionally, the email demands sensitive information, employing 'enticement with desire' by promising enhanced security through enrollment in a 2-way authentication system, which can seduce the recipient into compliance.

Completing all of the checklist items will automatically restore your
account access.",True,"This email exhibits several characteristics and implements tactics that are commonly associated with phishing attempts, informing the conclusion that it is likely a deceptive email. First, the email creates a sense of urgency by informing the recipient that their account access has been limited and prompts immediate action to restore full access. This tactic is designed to pressure recipients into acting hastily without critically evaluating the situation. The language used ('We recently reviewed your account,' 'your access to sensitive account features will be limited') aims to induce anxiety and a rushed response. Secondly, the email exploits the authority bias by impersonating the Credit Union, a trusted entity, to legitimize the request. The presentation as an official communication from a financial institution seeks to exploit trust and bypass skepticism. Moreover, the email provokes fear by suggesting that the account might have been accessed by an unauthorized third party, aiming to scare the recipient into complying with the instructions provided to 'protect' their account. This manipulative use of fear mirrors identified phishing strategies that threaten the recipient with potential loss or harm to solicit personal information or action. The call to action, 'Please confirm your identity here,' coupled with a vague yet urgent request to complete steps to 'Remove Limitations,' is a classic phishing hallmark. It attempts to entice the recipient into providing sensitive information or credentials under the guise of security, without giving specific details about the nature of the information needed or the exact process, which is suspicious. Lastly, the absence of personalized information such as the recipient's name, which is typically available to genuine financial institutions, further questions the email's legitimacy. The compilation of urgency, exploitation of authority, induction of fear, and the suspicious call to action aligns with known phishing patterns, heavily suggesting that the email's intention is deceptive."

Firstly, it creates an urgent need to act by suggesting the recipient's eBay account might be suspended within 48 hours if not confirmed, exploiting the urgency bias. This is designed to pressure the user into taking immediate action without proper verification. Secondly, the email induces fear by mentioning possible unauthorized listings on the account and potential law enforcement involvement, aiming to coerce the recipient into complying due to fear of legal consequences or account mishandling. Furthermore, the email falsely claims authority by presenting itself as an official communication from eBay, attempting to exploit the authority bias, making it more likely the recipient will comply with the request. The request for personal data including passwords and credit/bank numbers is a significant red flag; legitimate companies, especially of eBay's stature, do not request sensitive information in this manner due to security protocols.

- prometheus010928.pdf",False,"Analyzing the email based on the provided chain-of-thought framework yields no strong indications of phishing traits or manipulative biases. Here’s a breakdown according to the steps outlined: 

Characteristics Identified: The email content appears informational and does not exhibit urgent language, threats, overly enticing offers, false authority claims, immediate rewards, or vague curious promises. The email includes a feature on 'Power Semiconductors', an update on 'Independent power producers', and general news and commentary. This composition suggests its main goal is to inform rather than deceive.

Implementation Description: The language and tone used in the email seem professional and not pressing or threatening. There is no exploitation of current events, reputable brands for trust, or immediate gains promised. Given the context is an update on certain market aspects and a PDF attachment named in a manner consistent with typical industry reports (prometheus010928.pdf), it seems relevant to the content’s theme without presenting suspicious characteristics typically associated with malware spreading.

Phishing Conclusion: No. The email does not seem to follow common phishing patterns such as inducing urgency, fear, exploiting curiosity, or promising impossible rewards. The nature of the email aligns more with a regular newsletter or informational bulletin, lacking substantive phishing characteristics identified in the analysis framework."

Jennifer",False,"Upon analyzing the email's content, it does not specifically engage in any of the psychological traits or cognitive biases that are hallmarks of phishing attempts. Here's a breakdown of the analysis based on the framework provided: 

1. There's no creation of urgency beyond a reasonable request for a response by a certain time. The deadline appears to be for operational reasons rather than creating unnecessary pressure. 
2. The email lacks any sort of threat that induces fear. It's a straightforward call for information regarding claims, without any mention of negative consequences for the individual recipient. 
3. No enticing offers that appear too good to be true are presented. The email is asking for help or information regarding certain companies, not providing an unrealistic reward or benefit. 
4. The email doesn't falsely claim authority or expertise; it seems like an internal or organizational communication. 
5. It doesn't exploit recent events or use reputable brands or celebrity endorsements misleadingly to gain trust. The mentioned entities are part of the message's context, presumably relevant to the recipients' interests or responsibilities. 
6. There's no offer of immediate rewards. 
7. The message is direct and lacks a curiosity element with vague promises or intriguing attachments designed to lure individuals into a phishing trap. 

The overall tone and context of the email appear legitimate, focusing on what seems to be a routine operational procedure within an organization or among a specific professional group. It lacks phishing characteristics such as misleading links, requests for sensitive information, or exploiting cognitive biases and psychological traits commonly observed in phishing attempts. Therefore, the conclusion is that this email is not a phishing attempt. "

"Dear folks,
You may be interesting in this snippet of information about
Pat Michaels. Perhaps the University of Wisconsin ought to
open up a public comment period to decide whether Pat Michaels,
PhD needs re-assessing?
Michaels' PhD was, I believe, supervised by Reid Bryson. It dealt
with statistical (regression-based) modeling of crop-climate
relationships. In his thesis, Michaels claims that his statistical
model showed that weather/climate  variations could explain 95%
of the inter-annual variability in crop yields. Had this been
correct, it would have been a remarkable results. Certainly, it
was at odds with all previous studies of crop-climate relationships,
which generally showed that weather/climate could only explain about
50% of inter-annual yield variability.
How did result come about? The answer is simple. In Michaels'
regressions he included a trend term. This was at the time a common
way to account for the effects of changing technology on yield. It
turns out that the trend term accounts for 90% of the variability,
so that, in Michaels' regressions, weather/climate explains just 5
of the remaining 10%. In other words, Michaels' claim that
weather/climate explains 95% of the variability is completely
bogus.
Apparently, none of Michaels' thesis examiners noticed this. We
are left with wondering whether this was deliberate misrepresentation
by Michaels, or whether it was simply ignorance.
As an historical note, I discovered this many years ago when working
with Dick Warrick and Tu Qipu on crop-climate modeling. We used a
spatial regression method, which we developed for the wheat belt of
southwestern Western Australia. We carried out similar analyses for
winter wheat in the USA, but never published the results.
Wigley, T.M.L. and Tu Qipu, 1983:  Crop-climate modelling using spatial
patterns of yield and climate:  Part 1, Background and an example from
Australia. Journal of Climate and Applied Meteorology 22, 1831–1841.
There never was a ""Part 2"".

"Obamacare brings record low for US health uninsured rate
CNBC
How low can Obamacare go?
Fewer than 1 in 10 Americans lacked health insurance in 2015, the first time ever in the nation's history that the uninsured rate has fallen so low, and a clear sign of Obamacare's impact.
The U.S. uninsurance rate fell to 9.1 percent last year, according to data released Tuesday by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
It was the first time the percentage of people without some form of health coverage has gone into single digits, and a 2.4 percentage point drop from 2014.
The number of people uninsured in 2015 was 28.6 million, which was 7.4 million fewer than 2014, according to the CDC.
Since 2011, when the uninsured rate stood at 15.1 percent, that rate has fallen 6 full percentage points, according to the CDC's National Health Interview Survey.
Obamacare began going into full effect in 2014, which was the first year that people could have private health insurance plans purchased on government-run marketplaces. That was also the first year that nearly all Americans were obligated to have some form of health insurance or face a possible tax penalty.
Before that, the Affordable Care Act had for the first time allowed adults under the age of 26 to stay on their parents' health plans, which was another factor that has played a role in driving down the uninsured rate.
A third factor in bringing down the uninsured rate has been the expansion of Medicaid benefits in a majority of states to cover many more poor adults than had been eligible under that joint federal-state health insurance program before the ACA became law.
The Obama administration has said more than 20 million Americans have gained health insurance coverage since the ACA became law in 2010.
The new report Tuesday was warmly greeted by the Obama administration, which last week lost a key court decision that, if upheld, could damage the Obamacare program.
A federal court judge ruled that the administration violated the law by giving insurers money, without congressional approval, to offset the cost of covering subsidized out-of-pocket health costs of many Obamacare customers.
The administration also has been dealing with a flurry of news stories detailing possibly steeper Obamacare rate hikes for 2017, and the departure of some insurers from various markets across the nation.
Sylvia Burwell, secretary of health and human services, said, ""Today's report is further proof that our country has made undeniable and historic strides thanks to the Affordable Care Act.""
""The report documents the progress we've made expanding coverage across the country,"" Burwell said.
""Meanwhile, premiums for employer coverage, Medicare spending and health-care prices have risen at exceptionally slow rates. Our country ought to be proud of how far we've come and where we're going,"" she said.
The CDC's survey found that among adults aged 18-64, the percentage who were uninsured decreased from 16.3 percent in 2014 to 12.8 percent last year.
""A corresponding increase was seen in the percentage having private coverage, from 67.3 percent to 69.7 percent, respectively,"" the report said.
""Among children aged 0-17 years, the percentage who were uninsured decreased from 5.5 percent in 2014 to 4.5 percent in 2015,"" the report said.
""Among those under age 65, the percentage with private coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace [the federal Obamacare exchange HealthCare.gov] or state-based exchanges increased from 2.5 percent (6.7 million) in the fourth quarter of 2014 to 3.4 percent (9.1 million) in the fourth quarter of 2015,"" according to the CDC.
The report said that In 2015, adults between the ages of 25 and 34 were more than twice as likely as adults aged 45 to 64 to lack health insurance coverage - 17.9 percent compared with 8.8 percent.
""In 2015, 27.7 percent of Hispanic, 14.4 percent of non-Hispanic black, 8.7 percent of non-Hispanic white, and 7.9 percent of non-Hispanic Asian adults aged 18-64 lacked health insurance coverage at the time of interview,"" the report said.
""Significant decreases in the percentage of uninsured adults were observed between 2013 and 2015 for Hispanic, non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, and non-Hispanic Asian adults,"" the report said.
""Hispanic adults had the greatest percentage point decrease in the uninsured rate between 2013 and 2015,"" falling from 40.6 percent to 27.7 percent, according to the report.",False,"The email in question appears to be a news article rather than a direct personal communication. It reports on the decrease in the United States' uninsured rate following the implementation of Obamacare, referencing data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and quotes from Sylvia Burwell, secretary of health and human services. This content does not create an urgent need to act, threaten the reader, entice with unrealistic offers, falsely claim authority (since it cites actual authorities and legitimate data sources), exploit recent events for urgency, imply endorsements, offer immediate rewards, or aim to pique undue curiosity through vague or intriguing premises. Instead, it provides informational content regarding health insurance coverage trends in the U.S. Since it lacks the characteristics typical of a phishing attempt, such as pressing for immediate action, requesting personal information, or exploiting psychological traits and cognitive biases as outlined in the analysis framework, the conclusion is that this email is not a phishing attempt. It aims to inform the reader about the effects of Obamacare on insurance rates in the U.S., making it a legitimate piece of communication."
"Hi all,
Think it'd be a good idea for us to hit the Trump/Ryan joint statement, and get our perspective in stories. Drafted something below.
DNC National Press Secretary Mark Paustenbach issued the following statement:
""Donald Trump and Speaker Ryan didn't have to issue a joint statement for the American people to know that they are on the same page and believe in the same dangerous and divisive agenda.  The fact of the matter is that despite some personal disagreements, they both support the old Republican playbook of cutting taxes for the rich at the expense of middle-class families, they both oppose measures like equal pay and paid family leave, and they both support reckless policies that would only to drag America back into a recession. We simply can't afford to go back to losing 800,000 jobs a month as the last Republican president left office.""

[SigDems]",False,"Analyzing the email based on the outlined steps and psychological traits, the email doesn't exhibit typical characteristics of a phishing attempt. No sense of urgency is artificially created; it doesn't induce fear, offer too-good-to-be-true enticements, falsely claim authority, exploit recent events for urgency, imply reputable endorsements misleadingly, offer immediate rewards, or pique curiosity through vague or intriguing requests. The content is of a political nature, providing a statement on public figures' policy positions, and doesn't request any personal data or direct actions that would typically raise red flags for phishing. Furthermore, the contact information provided for the DNC and the specific individuals mentioned, like Mark Paustenbach and Walter Garcia, align with what would be expected from a genuine communication from the organization. The email's purpose appears to be merely to disseminate a political viewpoint rather than to deceive the recipient for malicious gain. Therefore, based on the context and lack of phishing characteristics, the email is concluded to be not a phishing attempt."
"Hi Peck et al,
Thanks for your note about the Africa borehole reconstructions, along
with the correspondence with Jason Smerdon. In my e-mail to you on
April 18,2006 I had indicated that the African work was unpublished.
However, I had forgotten that the Nature paper by Huang, Pollack and
Shen (Temperature trends over the past five centuries reconstructed
from borehole temperatures, Nature 403, pp 756-758, 2000) actually
showed the reconstructions for both southern Africa and Australia as
bar graphs of century-long changes in Figure 3 of that paper. The
figure displaying both the Africa and Australia borehole
reconstructions that appears in the FAR draft (Figure 6.12? or was it
6.11?) shows temperature vs. time for five centuries, a display that
differs from the bar-graphs in the Nature paper only in format, not
data.
Inasmuch as there have been no additions to the datasets since that
paper, it seems that we can correctly say that the reconstructions for
southern Africa and Australia have both been published in the Nature
(2000) paper. There is nothing ""wrong"" or outdated with either of those
reconstructions. We have, in addition, a newer and more expansive paper
about Australia alone (discussing the same reconstruction as appeared
in the Nature paper), now in press in the Journal of Quaternary
Science.  This paper was already mentioned in the e-mail of April 18,
2006, which I will paste at the end of this message.
Other questions?

Hi Keith (and Peck and Eystein),
I have recently been sent the current draft of the IPCC FAR by the US
Global Change
Research Program, asking for comments on the draft. This is the first
time I have seen
this product since we were feverishly exchanging e-mails in February.
Let me call to your
attention some small but not insignificant corrections to be made to
the next draft.
Page 6-33, Section 6.6.1.2, line 22.  The title of this section (in
italics) should be
changed to ""What do ground surface temperature reconstructions derived
from subsurface
temperature measurements tell us?""
Page 6-33, lines 49 and 52, there is a reference (Smerdon et al., in press).
This paper has now been published, so substitute ""2006"" for ""in press"",
and in the list
of references the citation should include the following:
J. Geophys. Res. 111, D07101, doi:10.1029/2004JD005578
Page 6-34, lines 43 and 44. This section is dealing with the southern
hemisphere. The
sentence ""...these both indicate unusually warm conditions prevailing
in the 20th century
(Pollack and Smerdon, 2004)""  , and the reference therein, are both incorrect.
The ground surface temperature changes over the last 500 years DO NOT
indicate unusually
warm conditions prevailing in the 20th century in Australia and
southern Africa. This is
because the unusually warm conditions developed late in the century,
after most of the
boreholes had already been logged.  What the borehole reconstruction
for Australia does
show is very good correspondence with the Cook et al (2000)
reconstruction for Tasmania
and the Cook et al. (2002) recon for New Zealand. The Australia work is
described in a
manuscript “Five centuries of Climate Change in Australia: The View
from Underground” by
Pollack, Huang and Smerdon now under review in the Journal of
Quaternary Science. The
Africa work is unpublished.
Is this e-mail to you sufficient to activate these changes? Or should I
submit these
comments to the US Government Review Panel? If I am to submit to the
latter, they require
all comments to be filed by May 9.
Cheers,
Henry

>",False,"The provided email does not exhibit any of the psychological traits or cognitive biases typically associated with phishing attempts. Instead, it details a professional and academic correspondence related to the publication and clarification of research data concerning borehole reconstructions in southern Africa and Australia. The language used in the email is specific to the scientific community and lacks any pressing, threatening, or overly enticing tones. It refers to previously published work and clarifies the status of data and publications, which is consistent with legitimate academic communication. Furthermore, there are no requests for personal information, financial details, or any action that could compromise security. The email also includes detailed contact information and references to reputable institutions (University of Michigan), which adds to its credibility. The detailed and context-specific nature of the communication, plus the absence of common phishing characteristics, supports the conclusion that the email is not a phishing attempt."
"Hello Jonathan, Keith, and Eystein:
I want to make a reminder about the embargo for release of the WRA Science comment article.  Please do not disseminate this article to anyone else, or discuss it publically until it is actually published, which I know Science wants to do soon.  I still believe citation is appropriate, and I have asked for clarification on this from the editors.  I will let you know what/if I hear from them.
FYI, this issue is also related to the NAS committee looking into last millenium surface temperature reconstructions this week, as I think you are aware.  Today, the NAS staff person working with this committee said he talked to Jesse Smith of Science about this article, who mentioned he could say nothing, but referred the staff person to me.  I was not really sure what this meant, and so I did not say anything specific on this myself, to ensure that I would not be in conflict with the embargo.  That is where it stands in that arena for now.
As you saw in the message from Steve Schneider that I copied to you, however, there is no embargo of any kind on use of the Climatic Change article.

Firstly, it creates a sense of urgency by emphasizing the importance of the recipients' participation in the survey to improve the webmail service. This pressure could motivate users to click on the provided link without properly evaluating the legitimacy of the email. Secondly, the email exploits authority bias by masquerading as an official communication from the IT Help Desk, a tactic designed to increase the likelihood of compliance due to the perceived legitimacy of the source. Additionally, the request is fairly vague, lacking specific details about the survey or how it contributes to improving the service, which aligns with the curiosity effect to entice recipients into wanting to learn more by clicking the link. The combination of urgency, exploitation of authority, and the trigger of curiosity with scant details all serve as common strategies employed in phishing to deceive recipients. Furthermore, the overall presentation lacks professionalism expected in genuine communications from an IT Help Desk, such as the informal language ('are urge to participate') and a timestamp from 2016, which could signify a reused or broadly distributed phishing template. Based on these identified traits and the implementation of these tactics, it is concluded that the email is likely a phishing attempt."

Ohio Savings Copyright © 2006",True,"This email exhibits several characteristics indicative of a phishing attempt, following the framework provided. Firstly, the email invokes a Sense of Urgency by highlighting 'recent fraudulent activities' and the immediate need to 'activate' a new security system. It pressures the recipient into acting quickly to verify their account information, which is a typical tactic used by phishers to bypass rational thinking. Secondly, it induces fear by suggesting the possibility of the recipient's account being 'stolen or hacked,' even though it then contradicts itself by stating the account has 'not been suspended or frozen,' creating a confusing scenario designed to alarm the recipient. Thirdly, there's an Authority Bias at play, as the email presents itself as being from 'Ohio Savings,' a supposed financial institution, aiming to exploit the recipient's trust in banking entities to coax them into revealing sensitive information. Additionally, the email asks the recipient to follow a link to 'Login' and review their account for 'any unauthorized transfer,' without providing any direct, secure link to the official website, which is suspicious. Moreover, the instruction not to reply to the message but to contact 'Customer Service' without providing any contact details utilizes vagueness further to elicit a panicked response from the recipient. Combining these elements with the lack of specific details (e.g., no direct contact information for customer service, the generic presentation, and the outdated copyright date which may be intended to leverage the Recency Effect incorrectly) aligns well with common phishing strategies aimed at collecting personal information. This email employs psychological manipulation and lacks authenticity markers characteristic of legitimate communications from financial institutions, leading to the conclusion that it is indeed a phishing attempt."

[1]",True,"The email under consideration employs several psychological traits and cognitive biases typically associated with phishing attempts. Firstly, the directive 'YOU ARE REQUIRED TO CLICK HERE' attempts to create a sense of Urgency, pressuring the recipient into acting quickly without giving them ample time to consider the legitimacy of the request. This urgency is a common tactic to bypass rational scrutiny. Secondly, the message is vague and lacks specific details about the update, invoking the Curiosity Effect. Recipients may feel compelled to click the link to satisfy their curiosity about the unspecified 'update.' However, the message does not specify what requires updating, who requires it, or why it's necessary, which are critical details one would expect in a legitimate communication. The lack of detailed information and the pressing tone are red flags. Moreover, there's an implicit Authority Bias exploited here; the email demands compliance without questioning, reminiscent of how authority figures might issue directives. But there's no indication of who's issuing the command, stripping the authority of legitimacy. Additionally, the use of a hyperlinked 'CLICK HERE' without a clear indication of the destination URL is a common phishing technique, aiming to lure the recipient into visiting a potentially malicious site designed to harvest personal information or infect their device with malware. Given these observations, particularly the urgency, lack of detail, exploitation of curiosity, and the attempt to invoke unquestioned authority, it aligns closely with known phishing patterns. Hence, the conclusion is that the email is likely a phishing attempt."

Thank You",True,"The email exhibits several traits and cognitive biases that are commonly exploited in phishing attempts. Firstly, it creates a sense of urgency by asserting that the recipient must act within 48 hours to avoid email account suspension, pressing them to act quickly without giving ample time for scrutiny. This tactic aims to exploit the psychological trait of scarcity and the urgency bias, pushing recipients toward hasty actions to avoid perceived losses. Additionally, the request to download and open an attached file is a red flag for phishing, as it's a common method used by attackers to distribute malware or redirect users to malicious websites. The attachment's file name is designed to seem legitimate but its true intent could be malicious. The email does not specifically induce fear, but it implies a negative consequence (email account suspension) if action is not taken, which can create a mild fear response encouraging compliance. There's no direct exploitation of authority bias, but the implicit suggestion that the message comes from an entity responsible for email account management could be interpreted as an attempt to claim false authority. Considering the overall presentation and the tactics used, the email aligns closely with known phishing strategies such as creating urgency, threatening negative outcomes, and prompting the download of potentially harmful files. Thus, it's likely a phishing attempt."
